AB,The use of web services for analysing and visualising maps has received
,"great attention recently, because the complicated analysis of spatial"
,data requires different processes to be run consecutively. Predicting
,the future location of a vehicle on a street network is one of the most
,challenging analyses used for improving context-aware location-based
,"services, intelligent transportation systems and criminology. In this"
,"research, the authors present a new short-term prediction algorithm and"
,explore the required analyses and web services. They present an
,appropriate method for chaining these web services to predict
,"location(s). To assess their methodology, they developed a prototype"
,system and tested for trajectories in Beijing. This system calculates
,the prediction time for a specified car to show the predicted future
,location in the street network. Their results showed that the average
,transferred data volume increases as the prediction period increases.
,The results also showed that the prediction algorithm has 75% accuracy
,at 1 min and 87.5% accuracy at 2 and 3 min. The implemented chaining
,method reduces the complexity of the location prediction algorithm for
,users because they do not need to know the processes. The outputs from
,this system can be used as input parameters for other web-based
,applications.

AB,The prediction of the destination location at the time of pickup is an
,important problem with potential for substantial impact on the
,efficiency of a GPS-enabled taxi service. While this problem has been
,"explored earlier in the batch data set-up, we propose in this paper new"
,solutions in the streaming data set-up. We examine four incremental
,"learning methods using a damped window model namely, Multivariate"
,"multiple regression, Spherical-spherical regression, Randomized"
,spherical K-NN regression and an Ensemble of these methods for their
,effectiveness in solving the destination prediction problem. The
,performance of these methods on several large datasets are evaluated
,using suitably chosen metrics and they were also compared with some
,other existing methods. We found that the Multivariate multiple
,regression method has the best performance in terms of prediction
,accuracy but the Spherical-spherical regression method is the best
,performer when we take into account the accuracy time trade-off
,"criterion. The next pickup location problem, where we are interested in"
,predicting the next pickup location for a taxi given the dropoff
,location coordinates of the previous trip as input is also considered
,and the aforementioned methods are examined for their suitability using
,"real world datasets. As in the case of destination prediction problem,"
,here also we find that the Multivariate multiple regression method gives
,better performance than the rest when we consider prediction accuracy
,but the Spherical-spherical regression method is the best performer when
,the accuracy-time trade-off criterion is taken into account.

AB,"With the increasing use of private vehicles with positioning services,"
,GPS trajectory data of vehicles has become one of the major sources of
,big data about urban life. Existing studies on mobility pattern mining
,"from trajectories share a common limitation, i.e., they fail to capture"
,the semantics of trajectories. Automatic derivation of semantic

,"we propose an approach, called SMOPAT (Semantic MObility PATterns), for"
,mining spatial-temporal semantic mobility patterns from trajectories of
,private vehicles. We design a probabilistic generative model with latent
,variables to characterize the semantic mobility of vehicles. Based on
,"the model, SMOPAT labels each location in a trajectory with a visit"
,purpose by using a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm. It
,then employs an efficient algorithm to find the most frequent semantic
,mobility patterns. We evaluate our approach on a large data set of real
,trajectories of private vehicles spanning a time duration of over ten
,"months with 114 million records in Shanghai, China. The experimental"
,results show that our approach produces meaningful patterns and

AB,"Recently, as location-based social networks (LBSNs) rapidly grow,"
,general users utilize point-of-interest recommender systems to discover
,attractive locations. Most existing POI recommendation algorithms always
,"employ the check-in data and rich contextual information (e. g.,"
,geographical information and users' social network information) of users
,"to learn their preference on POIs. Unfortunately, these studies"
,generally suffer from two major limitations: (1) when modeling
,"geographical influence, users' personalized behavior differences are"
,"ignored; (2) when modeling the users' social influence, the implicit"
,"social influence is seldom exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel"
,POI recommendation approach called GeoEISo. GeoEISo achieves three key
,goals in this work. (1) We develop a kernel estimation method with a
,selfadaptive kernel bandwidth to model the geographical influence
,between POIs. (2) We use the Gaussian radial basis kernel function based
,support vector regression (SVR) model to predict explicit trust values
,"between users, and then devise a novel trust-based recommendation model"
,to simultaneously incorporate both the explicit and implicit social
,trust information into the process of POI recommendation. (3) We develop
,a unified geo-social framework which combines users' preference on a POI
,with the geographical influence as well as social correlations.
,Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from
,Foursquare show that GeoEISo provides significantly superior
,performances compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation

AB,Most of us live our daily lives in various types of indoor environments.
,With the rapidly increasing air pollution and abnormal weather
,"conditions occurring all over the world, the importance of indoor space"
,is expected to increase in the future. As the importance of indoor
,"spaces has increased, there have been extensive efforts to understand"
,the indoor behavior patterns of individuals by collecting and analyzing
,"their indoor positioning data. However, indiscriminate collection of"
,"indoor location information may raise significant privacy issues,"
,because it is possible to infer sensitive information by analyzing their
,"indoor location data. Thus, there is a need to develop a technology"
,capable of: 1) collecting individuals' indoor positioning data while not
,"violating privacy requirements and 2) analyzing their movement patterns,"
,based on the indoor positioning data set collected in a
,"privacy-preserving manner. Recently, there has been a growing interest"
,in local difference privacy (LDP) that can protect individual privacy in
,the process of data collection. The main concept of LDP is adding
,carefully designed noise to sensitive data at the data contributor's
,"side and directly sending the noisy data to a data collector,"
,guaranteeing that the original data are not exposed to the outside. In
,"this paper, we first develop a method to collect individuals' indoor"
,"positioning information by leveraging LDP, and then, we introduce an"
,effective approach to compute top-k routes between two points in indoor
,environments by leveraging the indoor positioning data sets collected in
,an LDP manner. Experimental results show that the proposed approach well
,exploits the indoor positioning data collected in an LDP-compliant
,"manner, and a good estimation of top-k routes can be achieved with the"
,proposed method and a large data set.

AB,Moving route prediction offers important benefits for many emerging
,location-aware applications such as target advertising and urban traffic
,management. A common approach to route prediction is to match similar
,"trace recordings from a larger volume of historical trajectories, and"
,"return the targeted recorded path as desired answer. However, due to"
,"privacy concerns, incentive mechanism and other reasons, especially in"
,"small business environment, a limited dataset with sparse trajectories"
,"is only available. Actually, the existing sparse dataset cannot cover"
,"sufficient query routes, and then the match-based approach may return no"
,"results at all. Moreover, the existing sparse dataset may fail many"
,trajectory mining approaches that work well on general environment. In
,"this paper, we investigate moving route prediction from sparse"
,"trajectory dataset, and propose a novel hybrid model, namely HMRP, to"
,address the above problem. To avoid sparse distribution over spatial
,"semantic layer, a road network map reconstruction methods are proposed"
,to accommodate the sparse trajectories in semantic transformation. And
,"then, by training historical trajectories, the implicit mobility"
,patterns and Markov transition model are constructed to support route
,"prediction. When a query trajectory arrives, towards its derived"
,"potential destination, our proposed HMRP model integrates pattern"
,matching strategy and Markov probability distribution to predict its
,future route gradually in a complementary way. Experiments on real-life
,taxicab GPS recorded dataset demonstrate that HMRP method can improve
,"movement prediction precision significantly, comparing with the baseline"
,prediction algorithms. And the response time for each query trajectory
,is acceptable for most application cases.

,"daily life. Despite noticeable advantages such as being cheap, small,"
,"light, and easy to use, its limited positioning accuracy devalues and"
,hampers its wide applications for reliable mapping and analysis. Two
,conventional techniques to remove outliers in a GPS trajectory are
,"thresholding and Kalman-based methods, which are difficult in selecting"
,"appropriate thresholds and modeling the trajectories. Moreover, they are"
,"insensitive to medium and small outliers, especially for low-sample-rate"
,trajectories. This paper proposes a model-based GPS trajectory cleaner.
,Rather than examining speed and acceleration or assuming a
,"pre-determined trajectory model, we first use cubic smooth spline to"
,"adaptively model the trend of the trajectory. The residuals, i.e., the"
,"differences between the trend and GPS measurements, are then further"
,modeled by time series method. Outliers are detected by scoring the
,residuals at every GPS trajectory point. Comparing to the conventional
,"procedures, the trend-residual dual modeling approach has the following"
,features: (a) it is able to model trajectories and detect outliers
,adaptively; (b) only one critical value for outlier scores needs to be
,set; (c) it is able to robustly detect unapparent outliers; and (d) it
,is effective in cleaning outliers for GPS trajectories with low sample
,rates. Tests are carried out on three real-world GPS trajectories
,datasets. The evaluation demonstrates an average of 9.27 times better
,performance in outlier detection for GPS trajectories than thresholding
,and Kalman-based techniques.

AB,The proliferation of GPS enabled devices has led people to share
,locations both consciously and unconsciously. Large spatio-temporal data
,comprising of shared locations and whereabouts are now being routinely
,collected for analysis. As user movements are generally driven by their
,"interests, so mining these mobility patterns can reveal commonalities"
,"between a pair of users. In this paper, we present a framework for"
,mining the published trajectories to identify patterns in user mobility.
,"In this framework, we extract the locations where a user stays for a"
,period of time popularly known as stay points. These stay points help to
,identify the interests of a user. The statistics of pattern and check-in
,distributions over the GPS data are used to formulate similarity
,measures for finding K-nearest neighbors of an active user. In this
,"work, we categorize the neighbors into three groups namely strongly"
,"similar, closely similar and weakly similar. We introduce three"
,"similarity measures to determine them, one for each of the categories."
,We perform experiments on a real-world GPS log data to find the
,similarity scores between a pair of users and subsequently find the
,effective K-neighbors. Experimental results show that our proposed
,metric outperforms existing metrics in literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB,Frequent route is an important individual outdoor behavior pattern that
,"many trajectory-based applications rely on. In this paper, we propose a"
,novel framework for extracting frequent routes from personal GPS
,trajectories. The key idea of our design is to accurately detect road
,corners and utilize these new metaphors to tackle the problem of
,"frequent route extraction. Concretely, our framework contains three"
,phases: 1) characteristic point (CP) extraction; 2) corner detection;
,"and 3) trajectory mapping. In the first phase, we present a linear"
,"fitting-based algorithm to extract CPs. In the second phase, we develop"
,a multiple density level DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
,applications with noise) algorithm to locate road corners by clustering
,"CPs. In the third phase, we convert each trajectory into an ordered"
,sequence of road corners and obtain all routes that have been traversed
,by an individual for at least F (frequency threshold) times. We evaluate
,the framework using real-world trajectory datasets of individuals for
,one year and the experimental results demonstrate that our framework
,outperforms the baseline approach by 7.8% on average in terms of
,precision and 21.9% in terms of recall.

AB,We study the problem of learning individual route preferences of
,drivers. Most current route planning services only compute shortest or
,quickest paths. But many other criteria might play a role for a user to
,"prefer a certain route, as, e.g., fuel consumption, jam likeliness, road"
,"conditions, scenicness of the route, turns, allowed maximum speeds, toll"
,costs and many more. Specifying the importance of each criterion
,"manually is a non-trivial, unintuitive and time consuming undertaking"
,"for a user. Therefore, we develop approaches that deduce such"
,preferences automatically based on paths previously driven by the user.
,We present an LP-formulation of the problem making use of a
,Dijkstra-based separation oracle. The resulting algorithm runs in
,polynomial time and allows for the user preference computation in few
,seconds even if several hundred routes are taken into account. Our
,experiments show that new route suggestions based on these learned
,preferences reflect the users definition of an optimal route very well.

AB,Abstract In Brazil there is the perspective of significant growth in the
,volume of data being processed by vehicle tracking services companies as
,a result of natural increase in the use of tracking systems. This growth
,generates the need for the incorporation of analytical tools in the
,"management of vehicle tracking systems and risk managing, in order to"
,increase their efficiency and cater to the market growth. This paper
,aims to develop a model for identifying the Spatial Behavior Patterns of
,Monitoring Vehicles (SBPMV) using a spatial analysis tool to aid the
,process of decision making in vehicle monitoring and the urban
,transportation system management. Although the results obtained are
,"valid for the particular configuration presented in this article, the"
,proposed methodological analysis allows the characterization of spatial
,patterns of vehicle movements in the study area during the considered
,"period, which is useful, for instance, for city planners, enterprise"
,logistics and insurance companies. The conclusion is that the result of
,the comparison between the collected real-time positioning data with the
,spatial distribution model obtained through the characterization of the
,spatial behavior patterns is able to detect abnormalities in the vehicle
,movement behavior and provide subsidies to decision-making process for
,"vehicle monitoring and management systems, which aim the patrimonial and"
,"personal safety, and the identification of unexpected movement or risky"
,behaviors.

AB,The discovery of route patterns from trajectory data generated by moving
,"objects is an essential problem for location-aware computing. However,"
,the high degree of uncertainty of personal trajectory data significantly
,"disturbs the existing route pattern mining approaches, and results in"
,finding only short and incomplete patterns with high computational
,"complexity. In this paper, we propose a personal trajectory data mining"
,"framework, which includes a group-and-partition trajectory abstraction"
,technique and a frequent pattern mining algorithm called SCPM (Spatial
,Continuity based Pattern Mining). The group-and-partition technique can
,discover common sub-segments which are used to abstract the original
,trajectory data. The SCPM algorithm can efficiently derive longer and
,more complete route patterns from the abstracted personal trajectory
,data by tolerating various kinds of disturbances during the trips. Based
,"on the real-world personal trajectory data, we conducted a number of"
,experiments to evaluate the performance of our framework. The
,experimental results demonstrate that our framework is more efficient
,and effective as compared with the existing route pattern mining
,"approaches, and the extracted route patterns can be effectively utilized"

,"self-determined. Moreover, data mining serves an important role for"
,ubiquitous computing by providing intelligence to several types of
,"ubiquitous computing applications. Thus, automating ubiquitous data"
,mining is also crucial. We focus on the problem of automatically
,configuring the execution of a ubiquitous data mining algorithm. In our
,"solution, we generate configuration decisions in a resource aware and"
,context aware manner since the algorithm executes in an environment in
,which the context often changes and computing resources are often
,severely limited. We propose to analyze the execution behavior of the
,"data mining algorithm by mining its past executions. By doing so, we"
,discover the effects of resource and context states as well as parameter
,settings on the data mining quality. We argue that a classification
,model is appropriate for predicting the behavior of an algorithm's
,execution and we concentrate on decision tree classifier. We also define
,taxonomy on data mining quality so that tradeoff between prediction
,accuracy and classification specificity of each behavior model that
,"classifies by a different abstraction of quality, is scored for model"
,selection. Behavior model constituents and class label transformations
,are formally defined and experimental validation of the proposed

TI,Semantic Trajectory Based Behavior Generation for Groups Identification
SO,KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB,"With the development of GPS and the popularity of mobile devices with positioning capability, collecting massive amounts of trajectory data is feasible and easy. The daily trajectories of moving objects convey a concise overview of their behaviors. Different social roles have different trajectory patterns. Therefore, we can identify users or groups based on similar trajectory patterns by mining implicit life patterns. However, most existing daily trajectories mining studies mainly focus on the spatial and temporal analysis of raw trajectory data but missing the essential semantic information or behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory semantics calculation method to identify groups that have similar behaviors. In our model, we first propose a fast and efficient approach for stay regions extraction from daily trajectories, then generate semantic trajectories by enriching the stay regions with semantic labels. To measure the similarity between semantic trajectories, we design a semantic similarity measure model based on spatial and temporal similarity factor. Furthermore, a pruning strategy is proposed to lighten tedious calculations and comparisons. We have conducted extensive experiments on real trajectory dataset of Geolife project, and the experimental results show our proposed method is both effective and efficient."

TI,Analysis of User Network and Correlation for Community Discovery Based
,on Topic-Aware Similarity and Behavioral Influence
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS
AB,"While social computing related research has focused mostly on how to provide users with more precise and direct information, or on recommending new search methods to find requested information rapidly, the authors believe that network users themselves could be viewed as an important social resource. This study concentrates on analyzing potential and dynamic user correlations, based on topic-aware similarity and behavioral influence, which may help us to discover communities in social networking sites. The dynamically socialized user networking (DSUN) model is extended and refined to represent implicit and explicit user relationships in terms of topic-aware features and social behaviors. A set of measures is defined to describe and quantify interuser correlations, relating to social behaviors. Three types of ties are proposed to describe and discover communities according to influence-based user relationships. Results of the experiment with Twitter data are used to show the discovery of three types of communities, based on the presented model. Comparison with six different schemes and two existing methods demonstrates that the proposed method is effective in discovering influence-based communities. Finally, the scenario-based simulation of collective decision-making processes demonstrates the practicability of the proposed model and method in social interactive systems."

SO,PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB,"Analysing the mobility traces of moving agents (mobile users, GPS-equipped vehicles, CDRs, etc.) may help in interpreting the ""human interests and intentions: behind the movements and thus facilitates diverse range of location-based applications. The trajectory analysis uncovers the connections, correlations and differences among individuals and their activities by exploring their mobility attributes. This paper focuses on how mobility information (GPS traces) of a student exhibits correlation with her academic performance. The proposed framework analyses the GPS trajectories of students in an academic campus, models the mobility patterns of students using context-aware traj-graph (CTG), clusters signature mobility patterns and uncovers the correlation of mobility attributes with the academic performance of the students. A mobility knowledge graph has been constructed considering the entities, namely students, places of visits, movement behaviours, subjects, academic performances and the relationships among the entities. Using real-life dataset of an academic campus, we demonstrate that the mobility attributes are associated with students' academic performances and students' academic performance can be predicted from their movement behaviours."

SO,PLOS ONE
AB,"Trajectory data uploaded by mobile devices is growing quickly. It represents the movement of an individual or a device based on the longitude and latitude coordinates collected by GPS. The location based service has a broad application prospect in the real world. As the traditional location prediction models which are based on the discrete state sequence cannot predict the locations in real time, we propose a Continuous Time Series Markov Model (CTS-MM) to solve this problem. The method takes the Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) to simulate the posterior probability of a location in the continuous time series. The probability calculation method and state transition model of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are improved to get the precise location prediction. The experimental results on GeoLife data show that CTS-MM performs better for location prediction in exact minute than traditional location prediction models."

TI,Mining mobile application usage pattern for demand prediction by
,considering spatial and temporal relations
SO,GEOINFORMATICA
AB,"Recently, researches on smart phones have received attentions because the wide potential applications. One of interesting and useful topic is mining and predicting the users' mobile application (App) usage behaviors. With more and more Apps installed in users' smart phone, the users may spend much time to find the Apps they want to use by swiping the screen. App prediction systems benefit for reducing search time and launching time since the Apps which may be launched can preload in the memory before they are actually used. Although some previous studies had been proposed on the problem of App usage analysis, they recommend Apps for users only based on the frequencies of App usages. We consider that the relationship between App usage demands and users' recent spatial and temporal behaviors may be strong. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Temporal App Recommender (STAR), a novel framework to predict and recommend the Apps for mobile users under a smart phone environment. The STAR framework consists of four major modules. We first find the meaningful and semantic location movements from the geographic GPS trajectory data by the Spatial Relation Mining Module and generate the suitable temporal segments by the Temporal Relation Mining Module. Then, we design Spatial and Temporal App Usage Pattern Mine (STAUP-Mine) algorithm to efficiently discover mobile users' Spatial and Temporal App Usage Patterns (STAUPs). Furthermore, an App Usage Demand Prediction Module is presented to predict the following App usage demands according to the discovered STAUPs and spatial/temporal relations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously consider the spatial movements, temporal properties and App usage behavior for mining App usage pattern and demand prediction. Through rigorous experimental analysis from two real mobile App datasets, STAR framework delivers an excellent prediction performance."

TI,A novel recommendation system in location-based social networks using
,distributed ELM
SO,MEMETIC COMPUTING
AB,"Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have become a popular platform for people to communicate with each other. The recommendation problem has attracted considerable attention in both academia and industry as increasingly more users share their experiences and feelings using LBSNs. Machine learning has been widely used in many recommendation systems for recommending new friends or places of interest (POIs) to users in LBSNs. However, the majority of the existing recommendation systems were single function and only used small-scale datasets to provide recommendation services. In the era of big data, recommendation systems should have the ability to fully utilize limited computing resources for mining potential relationships from large-scale LBSN data. In this paper, a novel generic recommendation system is proposed by utilizing a distributed extreme learning machine called GR-DELM, which considers both friend recommendation and POI recommendation in large-scale datasets. For POI recommendation, three features are extracted: (1) geography-influenced feature, (2) popularity-influenced feature, and (3) social-influenced feature. For friend recommendation, two features are extracted: (1) neighborhood-based feature and (2) path-based feature. These features further improve the efficiency and accuracy of large-scale recommendation. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate that the GR-DELM system outperforms the existing recommendation systems."

SO,TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
AB,"Tracking facilities on smartphones generate enormous amounts of GPS trajectories, which provide new opportunities to study movement patterns and improve transportation planning. Converting GPS trajectories into semantically meaningful trips is attracting increasing research effort with respect to the development of algorithms, frameworks, and software tools. There are, however, few works focused on designing new semantic enrichment functionalities taking privacy into account. This article presents a raster-based framework which not only detects significant stop locations, segments GPS records into stop/move structures, and brings semantic insights to trips, but also provides possibilities to anonymize users' movements and sensitive stay/move locations into raster cells/regions so that a multi-level data sharing structure is achieved for a variety of data sharing purposes."

TI,Complete Your Mobility: Linking Trajectories Across Heterogeneous
,Mobility Data Sources
SO,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"Nowadays, human activities and movements are recorded by a variety of tools, forming different trajectory sets which are usually isolated from one another. Thus, it is very important to link different trajectories of one person in different sets to provide massive information for facilitating trajectory mining tasks. Most prior work took advantages of only one dimensional information to link trajectories and can link trajectories in a one-to-many manner (providing several candidate trajectories to link to one specific trajectory). In this paper, we propose a novel approach called one-to-one constraint trajectory linking with multi-dimensional information (OCTL) that links the corresponding trajectories of one person in different sets in a one-to-one manner. We extract multidimensional features from different trajectory datasets for corresponding relationships prediction, including spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal information, which jointly describe the relationships between trajectories. Using these features, we calculate the corresponding probabilities between trajectories in different datasets. Then, we formulate the link inference problem as a bipartite graph matching problem and employ effective methods to link one trajectory to another. Moreover, the advantages of our approach are empirically verified on two real-world trajectory sets with convincing results."

TI,Cluster-based trajectory segmentation with local noise
SO,DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
AB,"We present a framework for the partitioning of a spatial trajectory in a sequence of segments based on spatial density and temporal criteria. The result is a set of temporally separated clusters interleaved by sub-sequences of unclustered points. A major novelty is the proposal of an outlier or noise model based on the distinction between intra-cluster (local noise) and inter-cluster noise (transition): the local noise models the temporary absence from a residence while the transition the definitive departure towards a next residence. We analyze in detail the properties of the model and present a comprehensive solution for the extraction of temporally ordered clusters. The effectiveness of the solution is evaluated first qualitatively and next quantitatively by contrasting the segmentation with ground truth. The ground truth consists of a set of trajectories of labeled points simulating animal movement. Moreover, we show that the approach can streamline the discovery of additional derived patterns, by presenting a novel technique for the analysis of periodic movement. From a methodological perspective, a valuable aspect of this research is that it combines the theoretical investigation with the application and external validation of the segmentation framework. This paves the way to an effective deployment of the solution in broad and challenging fields such as e-science."

TI,Toward efficient business behavior prediction using location-based
,social networks
SO,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
AB,"Understanding business behavior in a city requires acquiring huge amount of data coming from diverse field studies. The growing use of mobile devices in social media provides massive data transactions that can replace such data acquired by field studies. Location-based social networks' (LBSNs') data can be exploited in urban analysis for economic reasons. In this research, the spatial correlation of business turnouts for venues registered in LBSNs is studied for business behavior predictions. A novel similarity embedded (SE)-spatial interpolation technique is proposed for business turnouts' predictions. The proposed technique utilizes diverse features provided by LBSNs in the prediction process to improve prediction performance. Moreover, a local filter is introduced to avoid local extreme involvements in the prediction process issuing better prediction results. To test the proposed techniques, experimental case study is implemented for predicting business behavior of venues registered in Foursquare in Texas. The proposed SE-spatial interpolation has shown better prediction accuracy than classical spatial interpolation predictions. The additional integration of the local filter shows further alleviated prediction errors. Furthermore, this study extends the work for the efficient application of the proposed prediction technique in big datasets. An iterative nearest neighbors first search method is designed for accelerating the execution time of the prediction technique implementation regardless the dataset size. The proposed method was tested over several size datasets. The test results show accelerated execution time for the proposed method when compared with the classical implementation execution time.

TI,Scalable Content-Aware Collaborative Filtering for Location
,Recommendation
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB,"Location recommendation plays an essential role in helping people find attractive places. Though recent research has studied how to recommend locations with social and geographical information, few of them addressed the cold-start problem of new users. Because mobility records are often shared on social networks, semantic information can be leveraged to tackle this challenge. A typical method is to feed them into explicit-feedback-based content-aware collaborative filtering, but they require drawing negative samples for better learning performance, as users' negative preference is not observable in human mobility. However, prior studies have empirically shown sampling-based methods do not perform well. To this end, we propose a scalable Implicit-feedback-based Content-aware Collaborative Filtering (ICCF) framework to incorporate semantic content and to steer clear of negative sampling. We then develop an efficient optimization algorithm, scaling linearly with data size and feature size, and quadratically with the dimension of latent space. We further establish its relationship with graph Laplacian regularized matrix factorization. Finally, we evaluate ICCF with a large-scale LBSN dataset in which users have profiles and textual content. The results show that ICCF outperforms several competing baselines, and that user information is not only effective for improving recommendations but also coping with cold-start scenarios."

AB,"Because of the widespread adoption of GPS-enabled devices, such as smartphones and GPS navigation devices, more and more location information is being collected and available. Compared with traditional ones (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, and Dangdang), recommender systems built on location-based social networks (LB-SNs) have received much attention. The former mine users' preferences through the relationship between users and items, e.g., online commodity, movies and music. The latter add location information as a new dimension to the former, hence resulting in a three-dimensional relationship among users, locations, and activities. In this article, we summarize LBSN recommender systems from the perspective of such a relationship. User, activity, and location are called objects, and recommender objectives are formed and achieved by mining and using such 3D relationships. From the perspective of the 3D relationship among these objects, we summarize the state-of-the-art of LBSN recommender systems to fulfill the related objectives. We finally indicate some future research directions in this area."

TI,GeoMF plus plus : Scalable Location Recommendation via Joint
,Geographical Modeling and Matrix Factorization
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB,"Location recommendation is an important means to help people discover attractive locations. However, extreme sparsity of user-location matrices leads to a severe challenge, so it is necessary to take implicit feedback characteristics of user mobility data into account and leverage the location's spatial information. To this end, based on previously developed GeoMF, we propose a scalable and flexible framework, dubbed GeoMF++, for joint geographical modeling and implicit feedback-based matrix factorization. We then develop an efficient optimization algorithm for parameter learning, which scales linearly with data size and the total number of neighbor grids of all locations. GeoMF++ can be well explained from two perspectives. First, it subsumes two-dimensional kernel density estimation so that it captures spatial clustering phenomenon in user mobility data; Second, it is strongly connected with widely used neighbor additive models, graph Laplacian regularized models, and collective matrix factorization. Finally, we extensively evaluate GeoMF++ on two large-scale LBSN datasets. The experimental results show that GeoMF++ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art and other competing baselines on both datasets in terms of NDCG and Recall. Besides, the efficiency studies show that GeoMF++ is much more scalable with the increase of data size and the dimension of latent space."

TI,Mining Individual Similarity by Assessing Interactions with Personally

SO,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB,"Human mobility is closely associated with places. Due to advancements in GPS devices and related sensor technologies, an unprecedented amount of tracking data has been generated in recent years, thus providing a new way to investigate the interactions between individuals and places, which are vital for depicting individuals' characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework for mining individual similarity based on long-term trajectory data. In contrast to most existing studies, which have focused on the sequential properties of individuals' visits to public places, this paper emphasizes the essential role of the spatio-temporal interactions between individuals and their personally significant places. Specifically, rather than merely using public geographic databases, which include only public places and lack personal meanings, we attempt to interpret the semantics of places that are significant to individuals from the perspectives of personal behavior. Next, we propose a new individual similarity measurement that incorporates both the spatio-temporal and semantic properties of individuals' visits to significant places. By experimenting on real-world GPS datasets, we demonstrate that our approach is more capable of distinguishing individuals and characterizing individual features than the previous methods. Additionally, we show that our approach can be used to effectively measure individual similarity and to aggregate individuals into meaningful subgroups."

TI,Activity Recommendation with Partners
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB
AB,"Recommending social activities, such as watching movies or having dinner, is a common function found in social networks or e-commerce sites. Besides certain websites which manage activity-related locations (e.g., foursquare.com), many items on product sale platforms (e.g., groupon.com) can naturally be mapped to social activities. For example, movie tickets can be thought of as activity items, which can be mapped as a social activity of ""watch a movie."" Traditional recommender systems estimate the degree of interest for a target user on candidate items (or activities), and accordingly, recommend the top-k activity items to the user. However, these systems ignore an important social characteristic of recommended activities: people usually tend to participate in those activities with friends. This article considers this fact for improving the effectiveness of recommendation in two directions. First, we study the problem of activity-partner recommendation; i.e., for each recommended activity item, find a suitable partner for the user. This (i) saves the user's time for finding activity partners, (ii) increases the likelihood that the activity item will be selected by the user, and (iii) improves the effectiveness of recommender systems to users overall and enkindles their social enthusiasm. Our partner recommender is built upon the users' historical attendance preferences, their social context, and geographic information. Moreover, we explore how to leverage the partner recommendation to help improve the effectiveness of recommending activities to users. Assuming that users tend to select the activities for which they can find suitable partners, we propose a partner-aware activity recommendation model, which integrates this hypothesis into conventional recommendation approaches. Finally, the recommended items not only match users' interests, but also have high chances to be selected by the users, because the users can find suitable partners to attend the corresponding activities together. We conduct experiments on real data to evaluate the effectiveness of activity-partner recommendation and partner-aware activity recommendation. The results verify that (i) suggesting partners greatly improves the likelihood that a recommended activity item is to be selected by the target user and (ii) considering the existence of suitable partners in the ranking of recommended items improves the accuracy of recommendation significantly."

TI,Real-Time Human Mobility Modeling with Multi-View Learning
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"Real-time human mobility modeling is essential to various urban applications. To model such human mobility, numerous data-driven techniques have been proposed. However, existing techniques are mostly driven by data from a single view, for example, a transportation view or a cellphone view, which leads to over-fitting of these single-view models. To address this issue, we propose a human mobility modeling technique based on a generic multi-view learning framework called coMobile. In coMobile, we first improve the performance of single-view models based on tensor decomposition with correlated contexts, and then we integrate these improved single-view models together for multi-view learning to iteratively obtain mutually reinforced knowledge for real-time human mobility at urban scale. We implement coMobile based on an extremely large dataset in the Chinese city Shenzhen, including data about taxi, bus, and subway passengers along with cellphone users, capturing more than 27 thousand vehicles and 10 million urban residents. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms a single-view model by 51% on average. More importantly, we design a novel application where urban taxis are dispatched based on unaccounted mobility demand inferred by coMobile."

TI,SocialMix: A familiarity-based and preference-aware location suggestion
,approach
SO,ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB,"Traditionally, location suggestion systems have employed collaborative filtering model to make recommendations for users based on data gathered from users with similar interests, demographics, and check-in records. However, these techniques fail to take into account on very important element present in online social networks, the online relationships that these users maintain. Arguably, this is the most important aspect of their online profiles, often more revealing than their self reported personal interests and check-in records. Aiming to improve the accuracy and novelty of recommendations, this research proposes a hybrid location suggestion algorithm, called SocialMix, of which, takes into full consideration a user's familiarity and preference (interest) similarity, along with relationships. In the first part of this study, we compute the degrees of familiarity between users using three feature variables: the number of mutual friends, the Jaccard index and cosine similarity. In order to determine the weights of the these feature variables, maximum likelihood estimation used, and then the features are fit to a Logistic Regression model in order to calculate the degrees of familiarity. The second part of this research we present a new method for calculating similarity between individuals by integrating users familiarity and preference similarity. This allows us to introduce a new location interest degree calculation method on the hybrid similarity. Extensive experiments were conducted on several real datasets. The performance of SocialMix was analyzed for both accuracy and time complexity using the following metrics: MAE (mean absolute error), RMSE (root mean square error), Precision, Recall, F-measure, Coverage rate, Popularity and Response time. Results were compared against classical recommendation approaches as a baseline. The results show that the accuracy and time performance of SocialMix, when compared with other algorithms which do not consider social relationships, are demonstratively improved. In addition, a positive by product worth noting is that SocialMix has a tendency to recommend more obscure but still interesting locations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

TI,RCA: A route city attraction model for air passengers
SO,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB,"Human movement pattern is a research hotspot of social computing and has practical values in various fields, such as traffic planning. Previous studies mainly focus on the travel activities of human beings on the ground rather than those in the air. In this paper, we use the reservation records of air passengers to explore air passengers' movement characteristics. After analyzing the effect of the route-trip length on the throughput, we find that most passengers eventually return to their original departure city and that the mobility of air passengers is not related to the route length. Based on these characteristics, we present a route city attraction (RCA) model, in which GDP or population is considered for the calculation of the attraction. The sub models of our RCA model show the better prediction performance of throughput than the radiation model and the gravity model. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V."

AB,"Recommender systems can mitigate the information overload problem by suggesting users' personalized items. In real-world recommendations such as e-commerce, a typical interaction between the system and its users is - users are recommended a page of items and provide feedback; and then the system recommends a new page of items. To effectively capture such interaction for recommendations, we need to solve two key problems - (1) how to update recommending strategy according to user's real-time feedback, and 2) how to generate a page of items with proper display, which pose tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we study the problem of page-wise recommendations aiming to address aforementioned two challenges simultaneously. In particular, we propose a principled approach to jointly generate a set of complementary items and the corresponding strategy to display them in a 2-D page; and propose a novel page-wise recommendation framework based on deep reinforcement learning, DeepPage, which can optimize a page of items with proper display based on real-time feedback from users. The experimental results based on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

Personal data including time-sequence data is often converted to anonymized datasets, which need to strike a balance between both privacy and utility. In this paper, we consider low-rank matrix decomposition as one of the anonymization methods and evaluate its efficiency. We convert time-sequence datasets to matrices and evaluate both privacy and utility. The record IDs in time-sequence data are changed at regular intervals to reduce re-identification risk. However, since individuals tend to behave in a similar fashion over periods of time, there remains a risk of record linkage even if record IDs are different. Hence, we evaluate the re-identification and linkage risks as privacy risks of time-sequence data. Our experimental results show that matrix decomposition is a viable anonymization method and it can achieve better utility than existing anonymization methods."

The three main types of people recommendation are based on the presumed level of relationship of the user with the recommended individuals and thereby the goal of the recommendation: from recommending familiar people the user may invite to their network or meet at a place, through recommending interesting people the user may subscribe to or follow, to recommending similar people the user may want to get familiarize with. We will demonstrate each of these recommendation types and the techniques used to address them through different case studies.

In our experiments, we varied the taxonomies construction parameters, like the number of used documents, then we compare the values that are returned in every case. Furthermore, we compared the results of our approach to two methods from the literature, using the Mean Average Precision (MAP) and the precision at 10 documents (P@10).

Besides that, in which specific circumstances the user will like a specific venue is predicted for each user-venue pair. Moreover, threshold values determining the user's liking toward a venue are determined separately for each user. Results are evaluated with both offline experiments (precision, recall, F-1 score) and a user study. Both the experimental evaluation with a real-world dataset and a user study of the proposed system showed improvement upon the baseline approaches."

SO,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
AB,"The popularity of camera phones and photo sharing websites, e.g., Flickr and Panoramio, has led to huge volumes of community-contributed geotagged photos, which could be regarded as digital footprints of photo takers. Thus, mining geotagged photos for travel recommendation has become a hot topic. However, most existing work recommends travel locations based on the knowledge mined from photo logs (e.g., time, location), and largely ignores the knowledge implied in the photo contents. In this paper, we propose a geotagged photos mining-based personalised gender-aware travel location recommendation approach, which considers both photo logs and photo contents. Firstly, it uses an entropy-based mobility measure to classify geotagged photos into tour photos or non-tour photos. Secondly, it conducts gender recognition based on face detection from tour photos. Thirdly, it builds the gender-aware profile of travel locations and users. Finally, it recommends personalised travel locations considering both user gender and similarity. Our approach is evaluated on a dataset, which contains geotagged photos taken in eleven cities of China. Experimental results show that our approach has the potential to improve the performance of travel location recommendation."

TI,Exploiting Spatial and Temporal for Point of Interest Recommendation
SO,COMPLEXITY
AB,"An increasing number of users have been attracted by location-based social networks (LBSNs) in recent years. Meanwhile, user-generated content in online LBSNs like spatial, temporal, and social information provides an ever-increasing chance to study the human behavior movement from their spatiotemporal mobility patterns and spawns a large number of location-based applications. For instance, one of such applications is to produce personalized point of interest (POI) recommendations that users are interested in. Different from traditional recommendation methods, the recommendations in LBSNs come with two vital dimensions, namely, geographical and temporal. However, previously proposed methods do not adequately explore geographical influence and temporal influence. Therefore, fusing geographical and temporal influences for better recommendation accuracy in LBSNs remains potential. In this work, our aim is to generate a top recommendation list of POIs for a target user. Specially, we explore how to produce the POI recommendation by leveraging spatiotemporal information. In order to exploit both geographical and temporal influences, we first design a probabilistic method to initially detect users' spatial orientation by analyzing visibility weights of POIs which are visited by them. Second, we perform collaborative filtering by detecting users' temporal preferences. At last, for making the POI recommendation, we combine the aforementioned two approaches, that is, integrating the spatial and temporal influences, to construct a unified framework. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art POI recommendation approaches."

More specifically, the research presented a novel approach to link and rank desktop resources by analysing users' activities over time, and exploited the associative links of resources from their implicit access patterns. Furthermore, multiple ranking methods, such as frequency of access, recency of access, focus time, and connectivity of resources, were proposed. Prototype systems were also developed, and a user study was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results showed that ranking desktop resources by their relevance - as carried out in this research - could improve activity-specific support, as well as overall performance in the area of personal information management."

Discovering socially interesting, popular or important locations from a location based social network has recently become important for recommender systems, targeted advertisement applications, and urban planning, etc. However, discovering socially important locations from a social network is challenging due to the data size and variety, spatial and temporal dimensions of the datasets, the need for developing computationally efficient approaches, and the difficulty of modeling human behavior. In the literature, several studies are conducted for discovering socially important locations. However, majority of these studies focused on discovering locations without considering historical data of social media users. They focused on analysis of data of social groups without considering each user's preferences in these groups. In this study, we proposed a method and interest measures to discover socially important locations that consider historical user data and each user's (individual's) preferences. The proposed algorithm was compared with a naive alternative using real-life Twitter dataset. The results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the naive alternative. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB,"The pervasive use of mobile devices and location-based services has supported the generation of large spatiotemporal datasets reflecting user movement behavior. However, studies on such type of data have depended heavily on geographic overlapping, and information about the time of day of travel visits has been overlooked. In this paper, we proposed an efficient method for mining user movement similarity based on users' travel histories as recorded by GPS trajectories. Our approach also allowed consideration of related temporal effects. To that end, first we introduced a partition method to divide the trajectories into a set of line segments that allowed us to explore the correlation between users and their visited territories. Significantly, we proposed a characteristic point mapping method to transform the sparse GPS trajectories into a set of transactional data. Based on this data, we conducted a series of data mining procedures for efficient discovery of the users' movement information. Second, we proposed a novel, lowrank matrix factorization-based method to cluster users' movements into groups based on their similarity, including temporal characteristics. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can be used to mine the popular roaming routes of users or similar movements efficiently while including temporal patterns. This approach can prove valuable for the development of location-based social network recommendations and human mobility prediction."

TI,Quantifying Tourist Behavior Patterns by Travel Motifs and Geo-Tagged
,Photos from Flickr
SO,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB,"With millions of people traveling to unfamiliar cities to spend holidays, travel recommendation becomes necessary to assist tourists in planning their trips more efficiently. Serving as a prerequisite to travel recommender systems, understanding tourist behavior patterns is therefore of great importance. Recently, geo-tagged photos on social media platforms like Flickr have provided a rich data source that captures location histories of tourists and reflects their preferences. This article utilizes geo-tagged photos from Flickr to extract trajectories of tourists and then extends the concept of motifs from topological spaces, to temporal spaces and to semantic spaces, for detecting tourist mobility patterns. By representing trajectories in terms of three distinct types of travel motif and further using them to measure user similarity, typical tourist travel behavior patterns associated with distinct sightseeing tastes/preferences are identified and analyzed for tourism recommendation. Our empirical results confirm that the proposed analytical framework is effective to uncover meaningful tourist behavior patterns."

,Check-Ins
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB,"The rapid expansion of urbanization and the fast pace of life result in abundant choices with little time for people to manage routes. A proper planning route enables us to enjoy life better with fewer time and energy costs. Therefore, route planning becomes too valuable to be ignored. At the same time, with the popularity of mobile devices, location sensing, and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social networks (e. g., Facebook Palaces and Foursquare) have attracted millions of users to share their visited locations and other information, which generates large amounts of user check-in data. These data can be used to mine users' preferences and time information for recommending routes. In this paper, we propose FineRoute, a personalized and time-sensitive route recommendation system. We take three factors that user' preferences, proper visiting time, and transition time into consideration for the route generation. First, we infer users' preferences by constructing a three-dimensional tensor, with three dimensions representing users, locations, and time, respectively. Second, we obtain the proper visiting time for certain locations, as well as the transition time between two locations from the check-in dataset. Moreover, we adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence in order to measure the quality of a route in terms of the proper visiting month and the proper visiting hour. Finally, we propose a route generation algorithm by extending the classic longest path algorithm. We conduct experiments on a real-world check-in dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme."

SO,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
AB,"Segmentation techniques partition a sequence of data points into a series of disjoint subsequences-segments-based on some criteria. Depending on the context and the nature of data themselves, segments return an approximate representation. The final result is a summarized representation of the sequence. This intuitive mechanism has been extensively studied, for example, for the summarization of time series in order to preserve the 'shape' of the sequence while omitting irrelevant details. This survey focuses on the use of segmentation methods for extracting behavioral information from individual mobility data, in particular from spatial trajectories. Such information can then be given a compact representation in the form of summarized trajectories, e.g., semantic trajectories and symbolic trajectories. Two major streams of research are discussed, spanning computational geometry and data mining respectively, that are emblematic of the multiplicity of views. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

TI,FE-ELM: A New Friend Recommendation Model with Extreme Learning Machine
SO,COGNITIVE COMPUTATION
AB,"Friend recommendation is one of the most popular services in location-based social network (LBSN) platforms, which recommends interested or familiar people to users. Except for the original social property and textual property in social networks, LBSN specially owns the spatial-temporal property. However, none of the existing methods fully utilized all the three properties (i.e., just one or two), which may lead to the low recommendation accuracy. Moreover, these existing methods are usually inefficient. In this paper, we propose a new friend recommendation model to solve the above shortcomings of the existing methods, called feature extraction-extreme learning machine (FE-ELM), where friend recommendation is regarded as a binary classification problem. Classification is an important task in cognitive computation community. First, we use new strategies in our FE-ELM model to extract the spatial-temporal feature, social feature, and textual feature. These features make full use of all above properties of LBSN and ensure the recommendation accuracy. Second, our FE-ELM model also takes advantage of the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. ELM has fast learning speed and ensures the recommendation efficiency. Extensive experiments verify the accuracy and efficiency of FE-ELM model."

SO,TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
AB,"Geographic services based on GPS trajectory data, such as location prediction and recommender services, have received increasing attention because of their potential social and commercial benefits. In this study, a Geographic Service Recommender Model (GSRM) is proposed, which loosely comprises three essential steps. Firstly, location sequences are obtained through a clustering operation on GPS locations. To improve efficiency, a programming model with a distributed algorithm is employed to accelerate the clustering. Secondly, in order to mine spatial and temporal information from the cluster trajectory, an algorithm (MiningMP) is designed. Last but not least, the next possible location to which the user will travel is predicted. An integrated framework of GSRM could then be constructed and provide the appropriate geographic recommendation service by considering location sequences as well as other related semantic information. Experiments were conducted based on real GPS trajectories from Microsoft Research Asia (182 users within a period of five years). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed GSRM model is effective and efficient at predicting locations and can provide users with personalized smart recommendation services in the following possible position with excellent performance in scalability, adaptability, and quality of service."

TI,Augmented Collaborative Filtering for Sparseness Reduction in
,Personalized POI Recommendation
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"As mobile device penetration increases, it has become pervasive for images to be associated with locations in the form of geotags. Geotags bridge the gap between the physical world and the cyberspace, giving rise to new opportunities to extract further insights into user preferences and behaviors. In this article, we aim to exploit geotagged photos from online photo-sharing sites for the purpose of personalized Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Owing to the fact that most users have only very limited travel experiences, data sparseness poses a formidable challenge to personalized POI recommendation. To alleviate data sparseness, we propose to augment current collaborative filtering algorithms along from multiple perspectives. Specifically, hybrid preference cues comprising user-uploaded and user-favored photos are harvested to study users' tastes. Moreover, heterogeneous high-order relationship information is jointly captured from user social networks and POI multimodal contents with hypergraph models. We also build upon the matrix factorization algorithm to integrate the disparate sources of preference and relationship information, and apply our approach to directly optimize user preference rankings. Extensive experiments on a large and publicly accessible dataset well verified the potential of our approach for addressing data sparseness and offering quality recommendations to users, especially for those who have only limited travel experiences."

TI,A Dynamic Topic Model and Matrix Factorization-Based Travel
,Recommendation Method Exploiting Ubiquitous Data
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB,"The vast volumes of community-contributed geotagged photos (CCGPs) available on the Web can be utilized to make travel location recommendations. The sparsity of user location interactions makes it difficult to learn travel preferences, because a user usually visits only a limited number of travel locations. Static topic models can be used to solve the sparsity problem by considering user travel topics. However, all travel histories of a user are regarded as one document drawn from a set of static topics, ignoring the evolving of topics and travel preferences. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topic model (DTM) and matrix factorization (MF)-based travel recommendation method. A DTM is used to obtain the temporally fine-grained topic distributions (i.e., implicit topic information) of users and locations. In addition, a large amount of explicit information is extracted from the metadata and visual contents of CCGPs, check-ins, and point of interest categories datasets. The information is used to obtain user-user and location-location similarity information, which is imposed as two regularization terms to constraint MF. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available Flickr dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate significantly superior recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art travel location recommendation studies."

TI,A Neural Network Approach to Jointly Modeling Social Networks and Mobile
,Trajectories
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB,"Two characteristics of location-based services are mobile trajectories and the ability to facilitate social networking. The recording of trajectory data contributes valuable resources towards understanding users' geographical movement behaviors. Social networking is possible when users are able to quickly connect to anyone nearby. A social network with location based services is known as location-based social network (LBSN). As shown in Cho et al. [2013], locations that are frequently visited by socially related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. To better analyze and mine LBSN data, we need to have a comprehensive view of each of these two aspects, i.e., the mobile trajectory data and the social network."
,"Specifically, we present a novel neural network model that can jointly model both social networks and mobile trajectories. Our model consists of two components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile trajectories. First we adopt a network embedding method for the construction of social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key to our model lies in generating mobile trajectories. Second, we consider four factors that influence the generation process of mobile trajectories: user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term sequential contexts, and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential relatedness in mobile trajectories at the short or long term levels. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In particular, the improvement over baselines is more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse."

SO,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB,"Travel products recommendation has become one of emerging issues in the realm of recommendation systems. The widely-used collaborative filtering algorithms are usually difficult to be used for recommending travel products due to a number of reasons, including (1) the content of travel products is very complex, (2) the user-item matrix is extremely sparse, and (3) the cold-start users are widely existing. To tackle these issues, we try to exploit Web server logs for generating recommendation, and present a novel recommendation engine (SECT for short) for travel products based on topic sequential patterns. In detail, we first extract topics from semantic description of every Web page. Then, we mine topic frequent sequential patterns and their target products to form click patterns library. At last, we propose a Markov n-gram model for matching the real-time click-stream of users with the click patterns library and thus computing recommendation scores. Experimental results on a real-world travel dataset demonstrate that the SECT prevails over the state-of-art baseline algorithms. In particular, SECT shows merits in improving the both coverage and accuracy for recommending products to cold-start users. Also, SECT is effective to recommend long tail items and outperform baseline algorithms."

Mining underlying factors affecting the income level will not only benefit the newcomers and low-income drivers but also assist in developing effective optimization algorithms for taxi operations. This paper intends to disclose the factors affecting incomes along with their quantitative influence by mining over 167 million GPS records from nearly 8000 taxis in Shanghai. We first identify a marked difference in drivers' incomes and categorize drivers into three income levels accordingly. We next investigate the overall search-delivery process, thereby defining several factors that may affect the income level. We then develop a generalized multilevel ordered logit (GMOL) model to find the significant factors that influence incomes. Finally, we compute the elasticity for those significant factors and present their contributions, as well as challenge some preconceived ideas regarding how to earn high incomes.

TI,ST-SAGE: A Spatial-Temporal Sparse Additive Generative Model for Spatial
,Item Recommendation
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs), spatial item recommendation has become an important mobile application, especially when users travel away from home. However, this type of recommendation is very challenging compared to traditional recommender systems. A user may visit only a limited number of spatial items, leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. This matrix becomes even sparser when the user travels to a distant place, as most of the items visited by a user are usually located within a short distance from the user's home. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically across different time and geographical regions. In light of this, we propose ST-SAGE, a spatial-temporal sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation in this article. ST-SAGE considers both personal interests of the users and the preferences of the crowd in the target region at the given time by exploiting both the co-occurrence patterns and content of spatial items. To further alleviate the data-sparsity issue, ST-SAGE exploits the geographical correlation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial index structure called the spatial pyramid. To speed up the training process of ST-SAGE, we implement a parallel version of themodel inference algorithm on the GraphLab framework. We conduct extensive experiments; the experimental results clearly demonstrate that ST-SAGE outperforms the state-of-the-art recommender systems in terms of recommendation effectiveness, model training efficiency, and online recommendation efficiency."

AB,Transport mode detection is an emerging research area in different
,"domains such as urban planning, context-aware mobile computing, and"
,intelligent transportation systems. Current approaches are mostly
,"data-driven, based on machine learning approaches. However, machine"
,learning models require substantial training data and cannot explain the
,reasoning procedure. Data-driven approaches also fall short while
,interpreting trajectories where ground truth information is limited.
,"Therefore, this paper develops a novel knowledge-based approach for"
,interpreting smartphone global positioning system trajectories by
,detecting various transport modes used during travel. The proposed model
,"is based on an expert system that can work without any training, based"
,solely on expert knowledge. Core is a fuzzy multiple-input
,multiple-output expert system using kinematic and spatial information
,with a well explained fuzzy reasoning scheme through a fuzzy rule base.
,The model can provide alternate predictions with varied certainty
,factors. Different membership function combinations have been evaluated
,"in terms of accuracy and ambiguity, and the result demonstrates that the"
,"model performs best using a Gaussian-Gaussian combination, comparable to"
,the existing machine learning approaches.

AB,We study multi-attribute trajectories by combining standard trajectories
,"(i.e., a sequence of timestamped locations) and descriptive attributes."
,A new form of continuous k nearest neighbor queries is proposed by
,integrating attributes into the evaluation. To enhance the query
,"performance, a hybrid and flexible index is developed to manage both"
,spatio-temporal data and attribute values. The index includes a 3D
,R-tree and a composite structure which can be popularized to work
,together with any R-tree based index and Grid-based index. We establish
,an efficient mechanism to update the index and define a cost model to
,"estimate the I/Os. Query algorithms are proposed, in particular, an"
,efficient method to determine the subtrees containing query attributes.
,"Using synthetic and real datasets, we carry out comprehensive"
,"experiments in a prototype database system to evaluate the efficiency,"
,scalability and generality. Our approach gains more than an order of
,magnitude speedup compared to three alternative approaches by using 1.8
,millions of trajectories and hundreds of attribute values. The update
,performance is evaluated and the cost model is validated.

AB,The ever-increasing volume of trajectories of moving objects and the
,diversity of intelligent transportation systems and location-based
,services that rely on spatio-temporal data of moving objects highlight
,the need for more efficient indexing techniques. The state-of-the-art
,methods index moving objects at three time modes of past (historical
,"data), present, and future. An integrated method called ""PCI"" was"
,proposed (past current indexing) to index and store spatial-temporal
,data of the past and present simultaneously. The method can handle
,queries in both the time modes and it processes and generates both the
,past and present indices using an integrated set of processing
,resources. Two interconnected data structures were utilized to store
,indices of' both the time modes. Connecting the index of different time
,modes enforces efficiency challenges due to difference in updating
,"costs. Since the method stores the indices in the main memory, the way"
,the structures are connected to each other makes it possible to transfer
,the current data to the section responsible for historical data. This
,method indexes them in the trajectory of moving objects at a minimum
,time expense. As the quality of data inevitably affects the performance
,"of applications, map matching methods was used in PCI to remove"
,"noises-e.g., stationary state noises-in the data received from the"
,moving objects. This feature adds to the accuracy and reliability of
,query results. The effects of data reduction techniques on accelerating
,"indexing, query processing, and reducing memory consumption (in"
,"voluminous data sets) were examined. Results of the comparisons, made"
,"based on the experiments, showed the higher efficiency of the indexing"
,structure.

AB,Location-based social networks (LBSN) have provided new possibilities
,"for researchers to gain knowledge about human spatiotemporal behavior,"
,and to make predictions about how people might behave through space and
,time in the future. An important requirement of successfully utilizing
,LBSN in these regards is a thorough understanding of the respective
,"datasets, including their inherent potential as well as their"
,"limitations. Specifically, when it comes to predictions, we must know"
,"what we can actually expect from the data, and how we could maximize"
,"their usefulness. Yet, this knowledge is still largely lacking from the"
,"literature. Hence, this work explores one particular aspect which is the"
,theoretical predictability of LBSN datasets. The uncovered
,predictability is represented with an interval. The lower bound of the
,interval corresponds to the amount of regular behaviors that can easily
,"be anticipated, and represents the correct predication rate that any"
,algorithm should be able to achieve. The upper bound corresponds to the
,"amount of information that is contained in the dataset, and represents"
,the maximum correct prediction rate that cannot be exceeded by any
,algorithms. Three Foursquare datasets from three American cities are
,"studied as an example. It is found that, within our investigated"
,"datasets, the lower bound of predictability of the human spatiotemporal"
,"behavior is 27%, and the upper bound is 92%. Hence, the inherent"
,potentials of the dataset for predicting human spatiotemporal behavior
,"are clarified, and the revealed interval allows a realistic assessment"
,of the quality of predictions and thus of associated algorithms.
,"Additionally, in order to provide further insight into the practical use"
,"of the dataset, the relationship between the predictability and the"
,check-in frequencies are investigated from three different perspectives.
,It was found that the individual perspective provides no significant
,correlations between the predictability and the check-in frequency. In
,"contrast, the same two quantities are found to be negatively correlated"
,from temporal and spatial perspectives. Our study further indicates that
,the heavily frequented contexts and some extraordinary geographic
,features such as airports could be good starting points for effective
,"improvements of prediction algorithms. In general, this research"
,provides novel knowledge regarding the nature of the LBSN dataset and
,practical insights for a more reasonable utilization of the dataset.

,on the knowledge of the human activities behind individual mobility

AB,We present a framework for the partitioning of a spatial trajectory in a
,sequence of segments based on spatial density and temporal criteria. The
,result is a set of temporally separated clusters interleaved by
,sub-sequences of unclustered points. A major novelty is the proposal of
,an outlier or noise model based on the distinction between intra-cluster
,(local noise) and inter-cluster noise (transition): the local noise
,models the temporary absence from a residence while the transition the
,definitive departure towards a next residence. We analyze in detail the
,properties of the model and present a comprehensive solution for the
,extraction of temporally ordered clusters. The effectiveness of the
,solution is evaluated first qualitatively and next quantitatively by
,contrasting the segmentation with ground truth. The ground truth
,consists of a set of trajectories of labeled points simulating animal

AB,Human mobility is closely associated with places. Due to advancements in
,"GPS devices and related sensor technologies, an unprecedented amount of"
,"tracking data has been generated in recent years, thus providing a new"
,"way to investigate the interactions between individuals and places,"
,which are vital for depicting individuals' characteristics. In this
,"paper, we propose a framework for mining individual similarity based on"
,"long-term trajectory data. In contrast to most existing studies, which"
,have focused on the sequential properties of individuals' visits to
,"public places, this paper emphasizes the essential role of the"
,spatio-temporal interactions between individuals and their personally
,"significant places. Specifically, rather than merely using public"
,"geographic databases, which include only public places and lack personal"
,"meanings, we attempt to interpret the semantics of places that are"
,significant to individuals from the perspectives of personal behavior.
,"Next, we propose a new individual similarity measurement that"
,incorporates both the spatio-temporal and semantic properties of
,individuals' visits to significant places. By experimenting on
,"real-world GPS datasets, we demonstrate that our approach is more"
,capable of distinguishing individuals and characterizing individual
,"features than the previous methods. Additionally, we show that our"
,approach can be used to effectively measure individual similarity and to
,aggregate individuals into meaningful subgroups.

AB,Construction is one of the most hazardous industries because it involves
,dynamic interactions between workers and machinery on sites. The recent
,technological developments in indoor positioning technologies provide a
,huge volume of spatio-temporal data for studying dynamic interactions of
,moving objects. The results from such studies can be used for enhancing
,safety management strategies on sites by recognizing the mobility
,related workers' behaviors. For understanding workers' mobility
,"behaviors to improve site safety, a system is proposed based on semantic"
,"trajectories and the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Firstly, the system"
,captures raw spatio-temporal trajectories of workers using an Indoor
,Positioning System (IPS) and preprocess them for determining the
,important stay locations where the workers are spending the majority of
,"their time. Then, these processed trajectories are transformed into"
,semantic trajectories to establish an understanding of the meanings
,behind workers' mobility behaviors in terms of the building environment.
,"Lastly, HMMs along with the Viterbi algorithm are used for categorizing"
,different workers' mobility behaviors within the identified stay
,locations. The proposed system is tested using an indoor building
,environment and the results show that it holds a potential to identify
,high-risk workers behaviors to improve site safety.

,The recommendation may also take into account some characteristics of
,"the points of interest (POIs) to be visited, such as the opening hours,"

,"the topic, most of them tailor the recommendation considering the user"

,"trajectory data into homogeneous, meaningful segments such as stops and"
,trips. Signal loss and signal noise are highly prevalent in human
,"trajectory data, and it is challenging to deal with uncertainties in"
,segmentation algorithms. We propose a new trajectory segmentation
,algorithm that detects stop segments in a noise-robust manner from GPS
,data with time gaps. The algorithm consists of three steps that impute
,"time gaps, split data into base segments and estimate states over a base"
,segment. The state-dependent path interpolation was proposed as a
,framework for gap imputation to deal with locational and temporal
,uncertainties associated with signal loss. A spatiotemporal
,clustering-based trajectory segmentation was proposed to detect
,spatiotemporal clusters of any shape regardless of density to cut a
,trajectory into internally similar base segments. Fuzzy inference was
,employed to deal with borderline cases in determining states over base
,segments based on input features. The proposed algorithm was applied to
,detect stop/move episodes from raw GPS trajectories that were collected
,from 20 urban and 19 suburban participants. Sensitivity analysis was
,conducted to guide the choice of parameters such as the temporal and
,spatial definitions of a stop. Experimentation results show that the
,"proposed method correctly identified 92% of stop/move episodes, and"
,correctly estimated 98% of episode duration. This study indicates that a
,"sequence of state-dependent gap imputation, clustering-based data"
,segmentation and fuzzy-set-based state estimation can satisfactorily
,deal with uncertainty in processing human GPS trajectory data.

AB,Trajectory pattern mining is becoming increasingly popular because of
,the development of ubiquitous computing technology. Trajectory data
,contain abundant semantic and geographic information that reflects
,"people's movement patterns, i.e., who is performing a certain type of"
,"activity when and where. However, the variety and complexity of people's"
,movement activity and the large size of trajectory datasets make it
,"difficult to mine valuable trajectory patterns. Moreover, most existing"
,trajectory similarity measurements only consider a portion of the
,information contained in trajectory data. The patterns obtained cannot
,be interpreted well in terms of both semantic meaning and geographic
,"distributions. As a result, these patterns cannot be used accurately for"
,recommendation systems or other applications. This paper introduces a
,novel concept of the semantic-geographic pattern that considers both
,semantic and geographic meaning simultaneously. A flexible density-based
,clustering algorithm with a new trajectory similarity measurement called
,semantic intensity is used to mine these semantic-geographic patterns.
,Comparative experiments on check-in data from the Sina Weibo service
,demonstrate that semantic intensity can effectively measure both
,semantic and geographic similarities among trajectories. The resulting
,patterns are more accurate and easy to interpret.

,"which regions are similar across cities. In this paper, we present a"
,method to answer such questions using publicly shared Foursquare data.

,"takes place. Compared to previous approaches to similar tasks, our"

,about the data-which relieves us from having to set arbitrary parameters
,"in our analysis (e.g., regarding the granularity of discovered regions"
,or the importance of different features). We demonstrate how the model
,learned with our method can be used to identify the most likely and
,"distinctive features of a geographical area, quantify the importance"
,"features used in the model, and discover similar regions across"

AB,Analyzing the spatial behaviors of moving-point objects (MPOs) and
,discovering their movement patterns have been of great interest to the
,geographic information science community recently. These interests can
,be explored through analyzing similarities in the MPO trajectories.
,"Because movements of objects take place in various contexts, their"
,"trajectories are also highly influenced by such contexts. Therefore, it"
,is essential to fully understand the contexts and to realize how they
,can be incorporated into movement analysis. This article first proposes
,"a taxonomy for contexts. Then, a modified version of dynamic time"
,"warping called context-based dynamic time warping (CDTW) is introduced,"
,to contextually assess the multidimensional weighted similarities of
,"trajectories. Ultimately, the results of similarity searches are"
,utilized in discovering the relative movement patterns of the MPOs. To
,"evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our proposed CDTW method,"
,we run several experiments on real datasets that were obtained from
,"commercial airplanes in a constrained Euclidean space, taking into"
,"account contextual information. Specifically, these experiments were"
,conducted to explore the role of contexts and their interactions in
,similarity measures of trajectories. The results yielded the robustness
,of CDTW method in quantifying the commonalities of trajectories and
,"discovering movement patterns with 80% accuracy. Moreover, the results"
,revealed the importance of exploiting contextual information because it
,can enhance and restrict movements.

AB,Spatiotemporal data mining studies the field of discovering interesting
,patterns from large spatiotemporal databases. Although these databases
,generate a huge volume of data daily from satellite images and mobile
,"sensors like GPS, among these data we find first spatiotemporal and"
,"geographical data; secondly, the trajectories browsed by moving objects"
,in some time intervals. Combination of these types of data leads to
,producing semantic trajectory data. Enriching trajectories with semantic
,"geographical information leads to ease queries, analysis, and mining, in"
,order to give more meaning to behaviors potentially extracted from

,trajectories continue to prove to be a success story in discovering
,useful and nontrivial behavioral patterns of moving objects. The purpose
,of this paper is to make an overview of spatiotemporal knowledge
,discovery (STKD) and techniques recently used to extract knowledge from
,spatiotemporal data based on analysis of recent literature. Then leading
,towards a deeper analysis about semantic trajectory knowledge discovery
,as a specified field from STKD that integrates trajectory sample points
,with geographical data before applying mining techniques in order to
,extract behavioral knowledge from semantic trajectories which can be
,more useful and significant for the application users.

,flexibly controlling the granularity of representing networks and the
,"cost of location updates and do not encompass semantic information, such"
,"as traffic states, traffic restrictions and social relationships. In"
,"this paper, we aim to fill the gap of traditional network-constrained"

,"adopts four graph structures, RouteGraph, SegmentGraph, ObjectGraph and"

,a prototype system with the native graph database system Neo4Jto
,"implement the proposed GSMNet model. In the experiment, we conduct the"
,performance evaluation using simulated trajectories generated from the
,BerlinMOD (Berlin Moving Objects Database) benchmark and compare with
,the mature MOD system Secondo. The results of 17 benchmark queries
,demonstrate that our proposed GSMNet model has strong potential to

AB,"As a consequence of the competition between different manufacturers,"
,current smartphones improve their features continuously and they
,currently include many sensors. Mobile Workforce Management (MWM) is an
,industrial process that would benefit highly from the information
,"captured by the sensors of mobile devices. However, there are some"
,problems that prevent MWM software from using this information: (i) the
,abstraction level of the activities currently identified is too low
,"(e.g., moving instead of performing an inspection on a client, or"
,stopped instead of loading a truck in the facility of a client); (ii)
,research work focuses on using geographic information algorithms on GPS
,"data, or machine learning algorithms on sensor data, but there is little"
,research on combining both types of data; and (iii) context information
,extracted from geographic information providers or MWM software is
,"rarely used. In this paper, we present a new methodology to turn raw"
,data collected from the sensors of mobile devices into trajectories
,annotated with semantic activities of a high level of abstraction. The
,methodology is based on activity taxonomies that can be adapted easily
,to the needs of any company. The activity taxonomies describe the
,expected values for each of the variables that are collected in the
,system using predicates defined in a pattern specification language. We
,also present the functional architecture of a module that combines
,context information retrieved from MWM software and geographic
,information providers with data from the sensors of the mobile device of
,the worker to annotate their trajectories and that can be easily
,integrated in MWM systems and in the workflow of any company.

AB,With the development of GPS and the popularity of mobile devices with
,"positioning capability, collecting massive amounts of trajectory data is"
,feasible and easy. The daily trajectories of moving objects convey a
,concise overview of their behaviors. Different social roles have
,"different trajectory patterns. Therefore, we can identify users or"
,groups based on similar trajectory patterns by mining implicit life
,"patterns. However, most existing daily trajectories mining studies"
,mainly focus on the spatial and temporal analysis of raw trajectory data
,but missing the essential semantic information or behaviors. In this
,"paper, we propose a novel trajectory semantics calculation method to"
,"identify groups that have similar behaviors. In our model, we first"
,propose a fast and efficient approach for stay regions extraction from
,"daily trajectories, then generate semantic trajectories by enriching the"
,stay regions with semantic labels. To measure the similarity between
,"semantic trajectories, we design a semantic similarity measure model"
,"based on spatial and temporal similarity factor. Furthermore, a pruning"
,strategy is proposed to lighten tedious calculations and comparisons. We
,have conducted extensive experiments on real trajectory dataset of
,"Geolife project, and the experimental results show our proposed method"
,is both effective and efficient.

AB,Mobile phone data are an interesting new data source for official
,"statistics. However, multiple problems and uncertainties need to be"
,"solved before these data can inform, support or even become an integral"
,"part of statistical production processes. In this article, we focus on"
,arguably the most important problem hindering the application of mobile
,phone data in official statistics: detecting home locations. We argue
,that current efforts to detect home locations suffer from a blind
,deployment of criteria to define a place of residence and from limited
,validation possibilities. We support our argument by analysing the
,performance of five home detection algorithms (HDAs) that have been
,"applied to a large, French, Call Detailed Record (CDR) data set (similar"
,"to 18 million users, five months). Our results show that criteria choice"
,in HDAs influences the detection of home locations for up to about 40%
,"of users, that HDAs perform poorly when compared with a validation data"
,"set (resulting in 35 degrees-gap), and that their performance is"
,sensitive to the time period and the duration of observation. Based on
,"our findings and experiences, we offer several recommendations for"
,"official statistics. If adopted, our recommendations would help ensure"
,more reliable use of mobile phone data vis-a-vis official statistics.

AB,"During the last decade, network providers are faced by a growing problem"
,regarding the distribution of bandwidth and computing resources.
,"Recently, the mobile edge computing paradigm was proposed as a possible"
,"solution, mainly in consideration of the provided possibility of"
,transferring service demands at the edge of the network. This solution
,"heavily relies on the dynamic allocation of resources, depending on the"

AB,Location prediction is essential to many commercial applications and
,enables appealing experience for business and governments. Many research
,"work show that human mobility is highly predictable. However, existing"
,work on location prediction reported limited improvements in using
,generalized spatio-temporal features and unsatisfactory prediction
,"accuracy for complex human mobility. To address these challenges, in"
,this paper we propose a Mobility Intention and Auto-Completion (MIAC)
,model. We extract those mobility patterns that generalize common
,"spatio-temporal features of all users, and use the mobility intentions"
,as the hidden states from mobility dataset. A new predicting algorithm
,based on auto-completion is then proposed. The experimental results on
,real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIAC model can
,properly capture the regularity of a user's mobility by simultaneously
,considering the spatial and temporal features. The comparison results
,also indicate that MIAC model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

AB,Object tracking systems play important roles in tracking moving objects
,"and overcoming problems such as safety, security and other"
,location-related applications. Problems arise from the difficulties in
,creating a well-defined and understandable description of tracking
,"systems. Nowadays, describing such processes results in fragmental"
,representation that most of the time leads to difficulties creating
,"documentation. Additionally, once learned by assigned personnel,"
,repeated tasks result in them continuing on autopilot in a way that

AB,"In this work, we investigate the performance of Markov Chains with"
,respect to modelling semantic trajectories and predicting future
,"locations. In the first part, we examine whether and to what degree the"
,semantic level of semantic trajectories affects the predictive
,performance of a spatial Markov model. It can be shown that the choice
,of the semantic level when describing trajectories has a significant
,impact on the accuracy of the models. High-level descriptions lead to
,better results than low-level ones. The second part introduces a
,"multi-dimensional Markov Chain construct that considers, besides"
,"locations, additional context information, such as time, day and the"
,users' activity. While the respective approach is able to outperform our
,"baseline, we could also identify some limitations. These are mainly"
,attributed to its sensitivity towards small-sized training datasets. We
,"attempt to overcome this issue, among others, by adding a semantic"
,similarity analysis component to our model that takes the varying role
,of locations due each time to the respective purpose of visiting the
,particular location explicitly into consideration. To capture the
,"aforementioned dynamics, we define an entity, which we refer to as"
,Purpose-of-Visit-Dependent Frame (PoVDF). In the third part of this
,"work, we describe in detail the PoVDF-based approach and we evaluate it"
,against the multi-dimensional Markov Chain model as well as with a
,semantic trajectory mining and prefix tree based model. Our evaluation
,shows that the PoVDF-based approach outperforms its competition and lays

AB,A large plethora of models to predict human mobility exists in the
,literature. The problem of how to select the most appropriate model to
,solve a specific mobility prediction task has however received only
,"little attention. Yet, a wrong model choice may lead to severe"
,"performance losses. In this paper, we address the model selection"
,problem in human mobility prediction and make the following
,"contributions. We present SELECTOR, a generic framework to explore human"
,mobility data and compute both population models and individual models
,to predict human mobility. The former are models that are adapted to the
,characteristics of an entire population of users and can be used to
,overcome the cold-start problem. The latter are prediction models
,optimized for individual users. We present and analyze the results
,"obtainable using SELECTOR on the Nokia data set, which is one of the"
,"largest and richest, publicly available data sets of human mobility"
,"data. We show that for many users, generic population models can be used"
,in place of individual models with negligible performance losses. Yet
,"for about 25 percent of the users, individual models perform at least"
,"three percentage points better than population models. Thereby, we show"
,that the use of phone context data does not lead to significantly better
,performance of human mobility predictors with respect to the case in
,which only temporal and spatial features are used. We further observe
,that the population models we derive are robust against the demographics
,of the users and that building different population models for different
,periods of the day leads to performance improvements. We make SELECTOR
,publicly available to allow other researchers and practitioners to
,explore further mobility data sets and to embed the code base of
,SELECTOR in their applications.

,has become an important and emerging approach to relieve congestion.
,Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data allow for abundant
,temporal and spatial information to be collected that reflect the
,"mobility and activity of drivers. In this paper, we present a"
,probabilistic model to predict driving trip paths based on a Hidden
,Markov Model (HMM). The first step in our approach was to detect the
,stays or destinations by using an improved algorithm based on taxi
,status information about whether or not the vehicle is occupied by
,"passengers. Next, the trips between two stays were extracted and"
,expressed as data chains for applying the learning scheme in a
,predictive model. A data-driven approach based on an HMM was trained
,with trips from a period of three months and then the model was used to
,predict the future links on which the vehicle may travel. A Linear
,Motion Function (LMF) was then utilized to infer the taxi position on
,"the predicted link. Furthermore, a learning algorithm was used to"
,"identify incorrect links for a given path. Finally, the effectiveness of"
,"the improved model was tested. In the testing process, samples that"
,"contained different trips with different taxi statuses (i.e., occupied"
,"and non-occupied) were considered, and the Relative Accuracy (RA) was"
,applied as a measure of effectiveness to evaluate prediction
,performance. The prediction results verified that the proposed method is
,an accurate and feasible potential approach that can be used to estimate
,driving paths in future time periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB,Location-Based Services (LBSs) provide users especially in smartphones
,with information and services based on their location and interests.
,Predicting people's next location could help in improving the quality of
,"such services and, in turn, boosting people's confidence on those"
,services. Any successful LBS algorithm or model should target three
,"major goals: Location prediction accuracy, high throughput or fast"
,response and efficiency in terms of utilizing smartphone resources. This
,paper proposes a new approach to discover and predict people's next
,"location based on their mobility patterns, while being computationally"
,efficient. The approach starts by discovering Regions-of-Interest (RoIs)
,in people's historical trajectories (which denote the locations where
,"users have been previously, frequently). A new model based on Markov"
,Chain (MC) is proposed to overcome the drawback of classical MC. Our
,proposed model considers both space and time contexts where the space
,represents a specific location that has been visited by a user while the
,time represents the location visiting time. We show how classical MC
,model can be extended to include movement times and how time will
,improve prediction accuracy. One unique finding in our research is
,related to the value of integrating users' mobility location/space with
,"time context. In particular, time context is formulated in a way to add"
,extra information to the space context. For better abstraction during
,"building the model, a general transformation function is used to"
,transform the n-order MC into first order. Results show that the
,proposed approach provides significant improvements in predicting
,people's next location compared with the state-of-the-art models when
,"applied on two large real-life datasets, GeoLife and Gowalla. (C) 2018"

AB,Where GPS technology can precisely register the spatiotemporal elements
,"of activity-travel behaviour, travel characteristics need to be imputed"
,"from the data. As such, throughout the last decade, a plethora of"
,methods has been developed to identify trips and activities from raw GPS
,"trajectories. However, rule-based methods that use dwell time for the"
,classification of activity and trip episodes may disregard short
,"activities. In addition, more advanced methods, such as machine learning"
,"classifiers, are typically used for travel mode recognition. This paper"
,therefore aims to systematically compare the relative performance of
,four machine learning algorithms to classify GPS points into activity
,points and travel points. To account for the underlying spatial
,"structure of the data, attribute information is supplemented by moving"
,multiple spatial windows over preceding and succeeding points to derive
,local densities. Because ground truth is essential to evaluate the
,"accuracy of the algorithms, a set of 200 artificial GPS activity-travel"
,sequences with varying noise levels was generated to test the
,performance of the algorithms. The results indicate that especially the
,random forest algorithm can lead to high accuracies and that local
,densities are important variables to the accuracy of the classifiers.

AB,Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have built bridges between
,virtual space and real-world mobility in recent years. The massive
,check-in data generated in LBSNs makes it possible to predict users'
,"future check-in location, which has proved meaningful for e-commerce"

,"check-in location with a coarse granularity, which only shows limited"
,"performance in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a"
,comprehensive approach based on user check-in pattern to predict users'
,"future check-in location at any fine-grained time in LBSNs. Firstly,"
,"users' check-in pattern involving time periodicity, global popularity"
,"and personal preference are analyzed. Secondly, we extract multiple"
,features related to user check-in pattern and explore the predictive
,"power of each individual feature. Thirdly, a set of features are"
,combined into a supervised scoring model and a classification model
,respectively for predicting user's check in location at a fine-grained
,"time in the future. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world"
,Foursquare datasets are carefully designed to verify the effectiveness
,of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that our approach
,outperforms both baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods on
,various evaluation metrics.

,processing on GPS trajectory data is to generate the time-stamped
,Sequence of Visited Locations (SVLs) of the mobile objects. The sequence
,is constructed by labeling each of the GPS observations of the
,trajectory using the ID of their intersecting Geometries of Interest
,"(GOIs). In this paper, we enhance the performance of the"
,state-of-the-art scheme for constructing the GOIs of a mobile object by
,proposing a data aggregation and outlier detection method. Our
,experimental results using geometric similarity metrics show that our
,improved GOI construction method outperforms the baseline methods by
,constructing the GOIs remarkably more geometrically similar to the real
,world GOIs. The geometric similarity metrics are only applicable when we
,have access to the geometries of the real world GOIs (ground truth). To
,be able to analyse the performance of the GOI extraction methods in
,"environments which we do not have access to the ground truth, we propose"
,two useful spatio-temporal metrics to measure the quality of GOIs based
,on the quality of the generated SVLs based on them. Our experimental
,results show that these two metrics are able to discriminate between the
,results of our different outlier detection methods and select the best
,scheme without using any external knowledge about the geometries of the
,real world GOIs.

,on time for a scheduled appointment. These likelihoods are used to
,update the clinic's schedule in real time. When a patient's arrival
,"probability falls below a given threshold, the patient's appointment is"
,canceled. This appointment is immediately reassigned to another patient
,drawn from a pool of patients who are actively seeking an appointment.
,The replacement patients are prioritized using their arrival
,"probability. Real-world data were not available for this study, so"
,synthetic patient data were generated to test the feasibility of the
,design. The method for predicting the arrival probability was verified
,on a real set of taxicab data. This study demonstrates that dynamic
,scheduling using geo-location data can reduce the number of unused
,appointments with minimal risk of double booking resulting from
,incorrect predictions. We acknowledge that there could be privacy
,concerns with regards to government possession of one's location and
,offer strategies for alleviating these concerns in our conclusion.

AB,The pervasive use of mobile devices and location-based services has
,supported the generation of large spatiotemporal datasets reflecting
,"user movement behavior. However, studies on such type of data have"
,"depended heavily on geographic overlapping, and information about the"
,"time of day of travel visits has been overlooked. In this paper, we"
,proposed an efficient method for mining user movement similarity based
,on users' travel histories as recorded by GPS trajectories. Our approach
,"also allowed consideration of related temporal effects. To that end,"
,first we introduced a partition method to divide the trajectories into a
,set of line segments that allowed us to explore the correlation between
,"users and their visited territories. Significantly, we proposed a"
,characteristic point mapping method to transform the sparse GPS
,"trajectories into a set of transactional data. Based on this data, we"
,conducted a series of data mining procedures for efficient discovery of
,"the users' movement information. Second, we proposed a novel, lowrank"
,matrix factorization-based method to cluster users' movements into
,"groups based on their similarity, including temporal characteristics."
,The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can be
,used to mine the popular roaming routes of users or similar movements
,efficiently while including temporal patterns. This approach can prove
,valuable for the development of location-based social network
,recommendations and human mobility prediction.

,in earthwork operations based on GPS traces from construction vehicles.
,The model incorporates relevant information extracted from the GPS data

,distributions over the environment. Monitoring of workstation locations
,may support map inference for generating and continuously updating the
,layout and road network topology of the construction environment. A case

,workstation identification methodology is used to infer the locations of
,loading stations based on vehicle speeds and interactions between

AB,Social media streams and remote sensing data have emerged as new sources
,"for tracking disaster events, and assessing their damages. Previous"
,"studies focus on a case-by-case approach, where a specific event was"
,"first chosen and filtering criteria (e.g., keywords, spatiotemporal"

,for disaster analysis. This paper presents a framework that synthesizes
,"multi-sourced data (e.g., social media, remote sensing, Wikipedia, and"
,"Web), spatial data mining and text mining technologies to build an"
,architecturally resilient and elastic solution to support disaster
,"analysis of historical and future events. Within the proposed framework,"
,Wikipedia is used as a primary source of different historical disaster
,"events, which are extracted to build an event database. Such a database"
,characterizes the salient spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of
,"each type of disaster. Additionally, it can provide basic semantics,"
,"such as event name (e.g., Hurricane Sandy) and type (e.g., flooding) and"
,"spatiotemporal scopes, which are then tuned by the proposed procedures"
,"to extract additional information (e.g., hashtags for searching tweets),"
,to query and retrieve relevant social media and remote sensing data for
,a specific disaster. Besides historical event analysis and pattern
,"mining, the cloud-based framework can also support real-time event"
,tracking and monitoring by providing on-demand and elastic computing
,power and storage capabilities. A prototype is implemented and tested
,with data relative to the 2011 Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 Colorado

AB,"With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs),"
,spatial item recommendation has become an important way of helping users
,discover interesting locations to increase their engagement with
,"location-based services. The availability of spatial, temporal, and"
,social information in LBSNs offers an unprecedented opportunity to
,enhance the spatial item recommendation. Many previous works studied
,spatial and social influences on spatial item recommendation in LBSNs.
,Due to the strong correlations between a user's check-in time and the
,"corresponding check-in location, which include the sequential influence"
,"and temporal cyclic effect, it is essential for spatial item recommender"
,system to exploit the temporal effect to improve the recommendation
,accuracy. Leveraging temporal information in spatial item recommendation
,"is, however, very challenging, considering (1) when integrating"
,"sequential influences, users' check-in data in LBSNs has a low sampling"
,"rate in both space and time, which renders existing location prediction"
,"techniques on GPS trajectories ineffective, and the prediction space is"
,"extremely large, with millions of distinct locations as the next"
,"prediction target, which impedes the application of classical Markov"
,"chain models; (2) there are various temporal cyclic patterns (i.e.,"
,"daily, weekly, and monthly) in LBSNs, but existing work is limited to"
,one specific pattern; and (3) there is no existing framework that
,"unifies users' personal interests, temporal cyclic patterns, and the"
,sequential influence of recently visited locations in a principled
,manner.
,"In light of the above challenges, we propose a Temporal Personalized"
,"Model (TPM), which introduces a novel latent variable topic-region to"
,"model and fuse sequential influence, cyclic patterns with personal"
,interests in the latent and exponential space. The advantages of
,modeling the temporal effect at the topic-region level include a
,"significantly reduced prediction space, an effective alleviation of data"
,"sparsity, and a direct expression of the semantic meaning of users'"
,"spatial activities. Moreover, we introduce two methods to model the"
,effect of various cyclic patterns. The first method is a time indexing
,scheme that encodes the effect of various cyclic patterns into a binary
,"code. However, the indexing scheme faces the data sparsity problem in"
,"each time slice. To deal with this data sparsity problem, the second"
,method slices the time according to each cyclic pattern separately and
,explores these patterns in a joint additive model.
,"Furthermore, we design an asymmetric Locality Sensitive Hashing (ALSH)"
,technique to speed up the online top-k recommendation process by
,extending the traditional LSH. We evaluate the performance of TPM on two
,real datasets and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The performance of
,TPM in recommending cold-start items is also evaluated. The results
,demonstrate a significant improvement in TPM's ability to recommend
,"spatial items, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, compared"
,with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB,Activity pattern classification is extensively studied using
,"multi-person single-day mobile traces. However, human mobility exhibits"
,intra-personal variability and thus single-day activity may not fully
,capture one's activity patterns. This paper creates a methodological
,framework to analyze similarity of activity patterns using frequent

,Frequent sequential pattern mining discovers the frequently occurring
,ordered subsequences and is a natural approach of analyzing multi-day
,travel patterns. Prefix Span algorithm is implemented to extract
,frequent patterns for each individual. Then similarity measures are
,defined to describe the extent to which two travelers' activity patterns
,are alike and the regularity of how one repeats her activity patterns
,from day to day. Based upon the pairwise similarity values between two
,"individuals, hierarchical clustering is conducted to divide travelers"
,"into communities. To illustrate these methodologies, 349 travelers'"
,"19,130 travel activity sequences are extracted from the world's first"
,"connected vehicle testbed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Three major clusters"
,"are identified. Coupled with demographics, these clusters are"
,"characterized as ""seniors"", ""working class"", and ""parents"","
,respectively. Multinomial logistic regression is employed to model to
,what extent the similarity of socio-demographics can explain that of
,travel patterns. This work can be extended to either infer an unknown

,networks' (LBSNs') data can be exploited in urban analysis for economic

,technique utilizes diverse features provided by LBSNs in the prediction

,introduced to avoid local extreme involvements in the prediction process
,"issuing better prediction results. To test the proposed techniques,"
,experimental case study is implemented for predicting business behavior
,of venues registered in Foursquare in Texas. The proposed SE-spatial
,interpolation has shown better prediction accuracy than classical
,spatial interpolation predictions. The additional integration of the

,this study extends the work for the efficient application of the
,proposed prediction technique in big datasets. An iterative nearest

AB,Urban travel time information is of great importance for many levels of
,traffic management and operation. This paper develops a tensor-based
,Bayesian probabilistic model for citywide and personalized travel time
,"estimation, using the large-scale and sparse GPS trajectories generated"
,by taxicabs. Combined with the knowledge learned from historical
,"trajectories, travel times of different drivers on all road segments in"
,some time slots are modeled with a 3-order tensor. This tensor-based
,modeling approach incorporates both the spatial correlation between
,different road segments and the person-specific variation between
,"different drivers, as well as the coarse-grain temporal correlation"
,between recent and historical traffic conditions and the fine-grain
,temporal correlation between different time slots. To account for the
,"variability caused by the intrinsic uncertainties in urban road network,"
,each travel time entry in the built tensor is treated as a variable
,following a log-normal distribution. With the help of the fully Bayesian
,"treatment, the model achieves automatic hyper-parameter tuning and model"
,"complexity controlling, and therefore the problem of over-fitting is"
,prevented even when the used data is large-scale and sparse. The
,proposed model is applied to a real case study on the citywide road
,"network of Beijing, China, using the large-scale and sparse GPS"
,"trajectories collected from over 32,670 taxicabs for a period of two"
,months. Empirical results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the
,proposed model provides an effective and robust approach for urban
,travel time estimation and outperforms the considered competing methods.

AB,Arriving on time and total travel time are two important properties for
,vehicle routing. Existing route guidance approaches always consider them
,"independently, because they may conflict with each other. In this"
,"article, we develop a semi-decentralized multiagent-based vehicle"
,routing approach where vehicle agents follow the local route guidance by
,"infrastructure agents at each intersection, and infrastructure agents"
,perform the route guidance by solving a route assignment problem. It
,integrates the two properties by expressing them as two objective terms
,"of the route assignment problem. Regarding arriving on time, it is"
,"formulated based on the probability tail model, which aims to maximize"
,the probability of reaching destination before deadline. Regarding total
,"travel time, it is formulated as a weighted quadratic term, which aims"
,to minimize the expected travel time from the current location to the
,destination based on the potential route assignment. The weight for
,total travel time is designed to be comparatively large if the deadline
,"is loose. Additionally, we improve the proposed approach in two aspects,"
,including travel time prediction and computational efficiency.
,Experimental results on real road networks justify its ability to
,"increase the average probability of arriving on time, reduce total"
,"travel time, and enhance the overall routing performance."

AB,Real-time human mobility modeling is essential to various urban
,"applications. To model such human mobility, numerous data-driven"
,"techniques have been proposed. However, existing techniques are mostly"
,"driven by data from a single view, for example, a transportation view or"
,"a cellphone view, which leads to over-fitting of these single-view"
,"models. To address this issue, we propose a human mobility modeling"
,technique based on a generic multi-view learning framework called
,"coMobile. In coMobile, we first improve the performance of single-view"
,"models based on tensor decomposition with correlated contexts, and then"
,we integrate these improved single-view models together for multi-view

,real-time human mobility at urban scale. We implement coMobile based on
,"an extremely large dataset in the Chinese city Shenzhen, including data"
,"about taxi, bus, and subway passengers along with cellphone users,"
,capturing more than 27 thousand vehicles and 10 million urban residents.
,The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms a single-view

AB,"Recently, as location-based social networks (LBSNs) rapidly grow,"
,general users utilize point-of-interest recommender systems to discover
,attractive locations. Most existing POI recommendation algorithms always
,"employ the check-in data and rich contextual information (e. g.,"
,geographical information and users' social network information) of users
,"to learn their preference on POIs. Unfortunately, these studies"
,generally suffer from two major limitations: (1) when modeling
,"geographical influence, users' personalized behavior differences are"
,"ignored; (2) when modeling the users' social influence, the implicit"
,"social influence is seldom exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel"
,POI recommendation approach called GeoEISo. GeoEISo achieves three key
,goals in this work. (1) We develop a kernel estimation method with a
,selfadaptive kernel bandwidth to model the geographical influence
,between POIs. (2) We use the Gaussian radial basis kernel function based
,support vector regression (SVR) model to predict explicit trust values
,"between users, and then devise a novel trust-based recommendation model"
,to simultaneously incorporate both the explicit and implicit social
,trust information into the process of POI recommendation. (3) We develop
,a unified geo-social framework which combines users' preference on a POI
,with the geographical influence as well as social correlations.
,Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from
,Foursquare show that GeoEISo provides significantly superior
,performances compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation
,models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB,Travel recommendation systems provide suggestions to the users based on
,"different information, such as user preferences, needs, or constraints."
,The recommendation may also take into account some characteristics of
,"the points of interest (POIs) to be visited, such as the opening hours,"
,or the peak hours. Although a number of studies have been proposed on
,"the topic, most of them tailor the recommendation considering the user"
,"viewpoint, without evaluating the impact of the suggestions on the"
,"system as a whole. This may lead to oscillatory dynamics, where the"
,choices made by the system generate new peak hours.
,This paper considers the trip planning problem that takes into account
,"the balancing of users among the different POIs. To this aim, we"
,"consider the estimate of the level of crowding at POIs, including both"
,the historical data and the effects of the recommendation. We formulate
,"the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, and we design a"
,recommendation engine that explores the solution space in near
,"real-time, through a distributed version of the Simulated Annealing"
,"approach. Through an experimental evaluation on a real dataset, we show"
,"that our solution is able to provide high quality recommendations, yet"
,maintaining that the attractions are not overcrowded.

AB,"Travelling is a critical component of daily life. With new technology,"
,personalized travel route recommendations are possible and have become a
,new research area. A personalized travel route recommendation refers to
,"plan an optimal travel route between two geographical locations, based"
,"on the road networks and users' travel preferences. In this paper, we"
,define users' travel behaviours from their historical Global Positioning
,System (GPS) trajectories and propose two personalized travel route
,recommendation methods - collaborative travel route recommendation
,(CTRR) and an extended version of CTRR (CTRR+). Both methods consider
,users' personal travel preferences based on their historical GPS
,"trajectories. In this paper, we first estimate users' travel behaviour"
,frequencies by using collaborative filtering technique. A route with the
,maximum probability of a user's travel behaviour is then generated based
,on the naive Bayes model. The CTRR+ method improves the performances of
,CTRR by taking into account cold start users and integrating distance
,with the user travel behaviour probability. This paper also conducts
,"some case studies based on a real GPS trajectory data set from Beijing,"
,China. The experimental results show that the proposed CTRR and CTRR+
,methods achieve better results for travel route recommendations compared
,with the shortest distance path method.

AB,The rapid expansion of urbanization and the fast pace of life result in
,abundant choices with little time for people to manage routes. A proper
,planning route enables us to enjoy life better with fewer time and
,"energy costs. Therefore, route planning becomes too valuable to be"
,"ignored. At the same time, with the popularity of mobile devices,"
,"location sensing, and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social"
,"networks (e. g., Facebook Palaces and Foursquare) have attracted"
,millions of users to share their visited locations and other

,and time-sensitive route recommendation system. We take three factors
,"that user' preferences, proper visiting time, and transition time into"
,"consideration for the route generation. First, we infer users'"
,"preferences by constructing a three-dimensional tensor, with three"
,"dimensions representing users, locations, and time, respectively."
,"Second, we obtain the proper visiting time for certain locations, as"
,well as the transition time between two locations from the check-in
,"dataset. Moreover, we adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence in order to"
,measure the quality of a route in terms of the proper visiting month and
,"the proper visiting hour. Finally, we propose a route generation"
,algorithm by extending the classic longest path algorithm. We conduct
,experiments on a real-world check-in dataset and the results demonstrate

AB,The vast volumes of community-contributed geotagged photos (CCGPs)

,only a limited number of travel locations. Static topic models can be
,used to solve the sparsity problem by considering user travel topics.
,"However, all travel histories of a user are regarded as one document"
,"drawn from a set of static topics, ignoring the evolving of topics and"

,(DTM) and matrix factorization (MF)-based travel recommendation method.
,A DTM is used to obtain the temporally fine-grained topic distributions
,"(i.e., implicit topic information) of users and locations. In addition,"
,a large amount of explicit information is extracted from the metadata
,"and visual contents of CCGPs, check-ins, and point of interest"

AB,Travel products recommendation has become one of emerging issues in the
,realm of recommendation systems. The widely-used collaborative filtering
,algorithms are usually difficult to be used for recommending travel
,"products due to a number of reasons, including (1) the content of travel"
,"products is very complex, (2) the user-item matrix is extremely sparse,"
,and (3) the cold-start users are widely existing. To tackle these
,"issues, we try to exploit Web server logs for generating recommendation,"
,and present a novel recommendation engine (SECT for short) for travel
,"products based on topic sequential patterns. In detail, we first extract"
,"topics from semantic description of every Web page. Then, we mine topic"
,frequent sequential patterns and their target products to form click
,"patterns library. At last, we propose a Markov n-gram model for matching"
,the real-time click-stream of users with the click patterns library and
,thus computing recommendation scores. Experimental results on a
,real-world travel dataset demonstrate that the SECT prevails over the
,"state-of-art baseline algorithms. In particular, SECT shows merits in"
,improving the both coverage and accuracy for recommending products to
,"cold-start users. Also, SECT is effective to recommend long tail items"
,and outperform baseline algorithms.

AB,People leave traces of movements that might affect the behavior of
,others both online in cyberspace and offline in real space. Previous
,"studies, however, have used only questionnaires, network data, or GPS"
,"data to study spatio-temporal behaviors, ignoring the relationship"
,"between online and offline activities, and overlooking the influence of"
,previous activities on future behaviors. We propose a Pheromone-based
,"Fusion Model, viewing human behaviors as similar to insect foraging"
,"behaviors to model spatio-temporal recreational activity patterns, on"
,"and offline. In our model, website data were combined with GPS data to"
,evaluate the attractiveness of destinations over time using twenty-nine
,"landscapes in Beijing, China; big website data and GPS trajectories were"
,gathered from 181 users for 57 months. The datasets were portioned into
,two periods. Online and offline recreational pheromones were calculated
,"from the first period, and the visitation rates were extracted from the"
,second period. These data were subsequently applied in a regression
,analysis to determine unknown parameters and estimate the attractiveness
,of destinations. The proposed method was compared with two other
,"approaches that use either GPS data or online data alone, in order to"
,verify effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method can
,"estimate future behaviors, based on real world and online past actions."

AB,This paper develops a principled approach to accurately identify
,interesting places in a city through social sensing applications. Social
,"sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm, where a crowd of"
,social sources (humans or devices on their behalf) collectively
,contribute a large amount of observations about the physical world. This
,"paper studies an interesting place finding problem, in which the goal is"
,to correctly identify the interesting places in a city. Important
,challenges exist in solving this problem: (i) the interestingness of a
,"place is not only related to the number of users who visit it, but also"
,depends upon the travel experience of the visiting users; (ii) the
,user's social connections could directly affect their visiting behavior
,"and the interestingness judgment of a given place. In this paper, we"
,develop a new Social-aware Interesting Place Finding Plus (SIPF+)
,approach that addresses the above challenges by explicitly incorporating
,both the user's travel experience and social relationship into a
,rigorous analytical framework. The SIPF+ scheme can find interesting
,"places not typically identified by traditional travel websites (e.g.,"
,"TripAdvisor, Expedia). We compare our solution with state-of-the-art"
,baselines using two real-world datasets collected from location-based
,social network services and verified the effectiveness of our approach.

AB,"With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs),"
,"spatial item recommendation has become an important mobile application,"
,"especially when users travel away from home. However, this type of"
,recommendation is very challenging compared to traditional recommender
,"systems. A user may visit only a limited number of spatial items,"
,leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. This matrix becomes even
,"sparser when the user travels to a distant place, as most of the items"
,visited by a user are usually located within a short distance from the
,"user's home. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary"
,dramatically across different time and geographical regions. In light of
,"this, we propose ST-SAGE, a spatial-temporal sparse additive generative"
,model for spatial item recommendation in this article. ST-SAGE considers
,both personal interests of the users and the preferences of the crowd in
,the target region at the given time by exploiting both the co-occurrence
,patterns and content of spatial items. To further alleviate the
,"data-sparsity issue, ST-SAGE exploits the geographical correlation by"
,smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial index
,structure called the spatial pyramid. To speed up the training process
,"of ST-SAGE, we implement a parallel version of themodel inference"
,algorithm on the GraphLab framework. We conduct extensive experiments;
,the experimental results clearly demonstrate that ST-SAGE outperforms
,the state-of-the-art recommender systems in terms of recommendation
,"effectiveness, model training efficiency, and online recommendation"

,Valvular heart diseases (VHD) is very common in clinical practice and
,has became the subject of growing attention in the field of
,cardiovascular medicine. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and
,"correlates of VHD in the general population in Xinjiang, China."
,Methods
,"Using a 4-stage stratified cluster random sampling method, a total of"
,14618 participants were recruited in the Cardiovascular Risk Survey
,"(CRS) study. The participants' personal information, medical history"
,were assessed by questionnaire. VHD was diagnosed by trans thoracic
,echocardiography. We carried out the statistical analysis utilizing SPSS
,Statistics version 19.0.
,Results
,"In the total study group, VHD was observed in 1397 (9.65%) individuals."
,"The prevalence rates of VHD in Han, Uygur and Kazak group are 13.51%,"
,2.71% and 12.29% respectively. The prevalence rates of VHD increased
,strikingly with age (all P < 0.001). The results of multinomial
,"regression analysis indicated that VHD were related to age in Han group,"
,"to age smoking and hypertension in Uygur group, to age and hypertension"
,in Kazak group.
,Conclusion
,Our research provides a unique prevalence rate of VHD in Xinjiang
,natural population. The result suggests that VHD are notably common in
,this population (9.65%) and increase with age. There exists significant
,difference of prevalence rate between ethnics. The main risk factors of
,"VHD are age, hypertension and smoking. Valvular heart diseases should be"
,regarded as a serious and growing public-health problem.

AB,Tourist trip design problems (TTDP) support tourists in creating trips
,composed of multiple points of interest (POIs) or other travel-related
,items. We present a novel approach to generate routes comprising
,different POIs with a reasonable routing for a short city trip. In our
,"scenario, a user enters a start and an end point in a web application"
,together with preferences and receives a walking route with interesting
,places to visit along the way. The place discovery is based on
,"retrieving arbitrarily rated places from Foursquare, so it is not"
,restricted to certain cities or regions. The developed scoring mechanism
,rates the level of interest of a POI and accounts for the number of
,places per category. Discovered places are then combined to a practical
,route using a constraint-free and a constraint-based version of our
,algorithm. The algorithms are based on Dijkstra's algorithm to find the
,shortest path in a graph. We show that Dijkstra's algorithm can be
,"modified to find not only the shortest paths, but also trips that solve"
,the TTDP by maximizing the entertainment for the user while respecting
,time and budget constraints. The solution has been implemented in a
,practical web application. We conducted a user study showing that our
,test users highly accepted the application. Improvement with regard to
,user preferences for place categories lead to additional benefits in
,terms of user satisfaction with the routing and the match with their
,"preferences. Finally, we outline challenges for future work on TTDPs in"

,Trajectory data mining finds numerous applications including
,understanding users' historical travel preferences and recommending

,"paper, we propose a differentially private trajectory analysis algorithm"
,for points-of-interest recommendation to users that aims at maximizing
,the accuracy of the recommendation results while protecting the privacy
,of the exposed trajectories with differential privacy guarantees. Our
,algorithm first transforms the raw trajectory dataset into a bipartite
,graph with nodes representing the users and the points-of-interest and
,"the edges representing the visits made by the users to the locations,"
,and then extracts the association matrix representing the bipartite
,graph to inject carefully calibrated noise to meet is an element
,of-differential privacy guarantees. A post-processing of the perturbed
,association matrix is performed to suppress noise prior to performing a
,Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) on the transformed data that
,generates an ordered list of recommended points-of interest. Extensive
,experiments on a real trajectory dataset show that our algorithm is

,characteristics of hotels with natural language processing (NLP); and
,"provided travel route recommendations with graph analysis. Second, we"
,developed a web-based interface to let users communicate with the system
,"interactively, which provides integrated recommendations including"
,"attractions, hotels, and visit route sequences. Two cities in the United"
,States (i.e. Atlanta and Chicago) were used as cases to illustrate our
,approaches. The proposed travel planning tool is not only beneficial to

,stops in trajectories of moving objects. Some methods consider as stops
,the sub trajectories that i) have speed lower than the average
,"trajectory speed, ii) present significant direction changes, iii) have"
,"gaps, or iv) intersect a given spatial region. In these approaches a"
,time constraint should be met for the subtrajectory to be considered as

,"of the movement context. In particular, big events influence human"
,"mobility depending on the dynamics of the events. However, this"
,"influence has not been explored to understand big events. In this paper,"
,we propose a methodology for learning about big events from human
,mobility pattern. The methodology involves extracting and analysing the
,"stopping, approaching, and moving-away interactions between public"
,transportation vehicles and the geographic context. The analysis is
,carried out at two different temporal granularity levels to discover
,global and local patterns. The results of evaluating this methodology on
,bus trajectories demonstrate that it can discover occurrences of big

AB,Massive taxi trajectory data is exploited for knowledge discovery in
,transportation and urban planning. Existing tools typically require
,users to select and brush geospatial regions on a map when retrieving
,and exploring taxi trajectories and passenger trips. To answer seemingly
,"simple questions such as ""What were the taxi trips starting from Main"
,"Street and ending at Wall Street in the morning?"" or ""Where are the"
,"taxis arriving at the Art Museum at noon typically coming from?"","
,tedious and time consuming interactions are usually needed since the
,numeric GPS points of trajectories are not directly linked to the
,"keywords such as ""Main Street"", ""Wall Street"", and ""Art Museum"". In this"
,"paper, we present SemanticTraj, a new method for managing and"
,"visualizing taxi trajectory data in an intuitive, semantic rich, and"
,"efficient means. With SemanticTraj, domain and public users can find"
,answers to the aforementioned questions easily through direct queries
,based on the terms. They can also interactively explore the retrieved
,data in visualizations enhanced by semantic information of the
,"trajectories and trips. In particular, taxi trajectories are converted"
,into taxi documents through a textualization transformation process.
,This process maps GPS points into a series of street/POI names and
,pick-up/drop-off locations. It also converts vehicle speeds into
,"user-defined descriptive terms. Then, a corpus of taxi documents is"
,formed and indexed to enable flexible semantic queries over a text
,search engine. Semantic labels and meta-summaries of the results are
,"integrated with a set of visualizations in a SemanticTraj prototype,"
,which helps users study taxi trajectories quickly and easily. A set of
,usage scenarios are presented to show the usability of the system. We
,also collected feedback from domain experts and conducted a preliminary
,user study to evaluate the visual system.

AB,The rapid growth of location-based services has motivated the
,development of continuous range queries in networks. Existing query
,algorithms usually adopt an expansion tree to reuse the previous query
,"results to get better efficiency. However, the high maintenance costs of"
,the traditional expansion tree lead to a sharp efficiency decrease. In

,"algorithm for moving objects in networks, which is characterized by a"
,novel graph-based expansion tree (GET) structure used to monitor queries
,"in an incremental manner. In particular, GET is developed based on the"
,line graph model of networks and simultaneously supports offline
,pre-computation to better adapt our proposed algorithm to different
,"sizes of networks. To improve performance, we create a series of related"
,"data structures, such as bridgeable edges and distance edges."
,"Correspondingly, we develop several algorithms, including"
,"initialization, insertion of objects, filter and refinement and location"

AB,Tracking the spatio-temporal activity is highly relevant for domains
,"like security, health, and quality management. Since animal welfare"
,became a topic in politics and legislation locomotion patterns of
,livestock have received increasing interest. In contrast to the
,monitoring of pedestrians cattle activity tracking poses special
,challenges to both sensors and data analysis. Interesting states are not
,"directly observable by a single sensor. In addition, sensors must be"
,accepted by cattle and need to be robust enough to cope with a rough

,heart rate and positioning sensors. Attached to neck and chest they are
,less interfering than accelerometers at the ankles. Exploiting the
,potential of such combined sensor system that records locomotion and
,non-spatial information from the heart rate sensor however is
,challenging. We introduce a novel two level method for the activity
,tracking focused on the duration and sequence of activity states. We
,combine Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Conditional Random Field (CRF)
,and extend Conditional Random fields by an explicit representation of
,"duration. The SVM characterizes local activity states, whereas the CRF"
,addresses sequences of local states to sequences incorporating spatial
,and non-spatial contextual knowledge. This combination provides a
,"reliable and comprehensive identification of defined activity patterns,"
,"as well as their chronology and durations, suitable for the integration"
,in an activity data base. This data base is used to extract
,physiological parameters and promises insights into internal states such

AB,Urban road traffic is highly dynamic. Traffic conditions vary in time
,and with location and so do the movement patterns of individual road
,"users. In this article, a movement pattern is the behaviour of a car"
,when traversing a road link in an urban road network. A movement pattern
,"can be recorded with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such"
,as the Global Positioning System (GPS). A movement pattern has a
,"specific energy-efficiency, which is a measure of how fuel-intensively"
,"the car is moving. For example, a car driving uniformly at medium speed"
,"consumes little fuel and, therefore, is energy-efficient, whereas"
,stop-and-go driving consumes much fuel and is energy-inefficient. In
,this article we introduce a model to estimate the energy-efficiency of
,"movement patterns in urban road traffic from GNSS data. First, we"
,derived statistical features about the car's movement along the road.
,"Then, we compared these to fuel consumption data from the car's"
,"controller area network (CAN) bus, normalized to the car's overall range"
,of fuel consumption. We identified the optimal feature set for
,"prediction. With the optimal feature set we trained, tested and verified"
,"a model to estimate energy-efficiency, with the fuel consumption serving"
,as ground truth. Existing fuel consumption models usually view movement
,"as a snapshot. Thus, the behaviour of the car remains unknown that"
,causes a movement pattern to be energy-efficient or energy-inefficient.
,Our model views movement as a process and allows to interpret this
,"process. A movement pattern can, for example, be energy-inefficient"
,"because the car is driving in stop-and-go traffic, because it is"
,"travelling at high speed, or because it is accelerating. Our model"
,"allows to distinguish between these different types of behaviours. Thus,"
,it can provide new insights into the dynamics of urban road traffic and
,its energy-efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

,"multi-modal transportation. When an airplane diverts, logistics"
,providers must promptly adapt their transportation plans in order to
,"ensure proper delivery despite such an unexpected event. In practice,"
,the different parties in a logistics chain do not exchange real-time
,information related to flights. This calls for a means to detect
,"diversions that just requires publicly available data, thus being"
,independent of the communication between different parties. The
,dependence on public data results in a challenge to detect anomalous

,Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a prediction model that
,"just requires information on an airplane's position, velocity, and"
,intended destination. This information is used to distinguish between
,regular and anomalous behavior.
,When an airplane displays anomalous behavior for an extended period of
,"time, the model predicts a diversion. A quantitative evaluation shows"
,that this approach is able to detect diverting airplanes with excellent
,precision and recall even without knowing planned trajectories as

AB,Taxi trajectories reflect human mobility over a road network. Pick-up
,and drop-off locations in different time periods represent origins and
,"destinations of trips, respectively, demonstrating the spatiotemporal"
,characteristics of human behavior. Each trip can be viewed as a
,"displacement in the random walk model, and the distribution of extracted"
,trips shows a distance decay effect. To identify the spatial similarity
,"of trips at a finer scale, this paper investigates the distribution of"
,"trips through topic modeling techniques. Firstly, trip origins and trip"
,"destinations were identified from raw GPS data. Then, different trips"
,"were given semantic information, i.e., link identification numbers with"
,a semantic enrichment process. Each taxi trajectory was composed of a
,series of trip destinations corresponding to the same taxi.
,"Subsequently, each taxi trajectory was analogous to a document"

,topics reflecting the spatial similarity and regional property of human
,mobility through LDA topic model training. The effectiveness of this
,approach was illustrated by a case study using a large dataset of taxi

AB,Partial migration is a crucial mobility pattern in animal ecology.
,Unlike complete migrations that take place when all the individuals in a
,"population migrate with a clear separation of ranges, partial migrations"
,are migrations that often follow modalities and times that vary from
,animal to animal. As a result the distinction between migratory and
,"nonmigratory behavior becomes less defined. In this paper, we present an"
,"interdisciplinary effort geared to evaluate whether a recent time-aware,"
,"density-based clustering technique, called SeqScan, relying on the novel"
,concept of object's presence can be effectively applied to the study of
,"partial migrations. To that end, we propose an extended framework"
,"centered on SeqScan, comprising a noise model for the detection of"
,"fine-grained movement patterns, i.e. excursions and inter-cluster"
,"transitions, and an internal time-aware validity index, for clustering"
,"evaluation. Furthermore, we contrast SeqScan with a recent technique"
,developed in the context of animal ecology and grounded on statistical
,"methods. For the study, we use real trajectories from two large"
,herbivorous species located in Bavaria. We argue that the classification
,capabilities of SeqScan are comparable to those of the reference method.
,"Moreover, the SeqScan framework overcomes important limitations of more"
,"conventional techniques, offering, in particular, the opportunity of"

AB,Human mobility is important for understanding the evolution of size and
,"structure of urban areas, the spatial distribution of facilities, and"
,"the provision of transportation services. Until recently, exploring"
,human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods
,"consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or"
,interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly
,altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human
,movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in
,"identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate"
,solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental
,context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt
,to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of
,human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and
,contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the
,identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places)
,"behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and"
,spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how
,"travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the"
,"tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which"
,are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend
,time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We
,evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205
,volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of
,places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this
,study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new
,possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.

AB,Global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning
,System (GPS) is one of the most important sensors for movement analysis.
,"GPS is widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and"
,"human beings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both"
,measurement and interpolation errors. In this article we show that
,measurement error causes a systematic bias in distances recorded with a
,GPS; the distance between two points recorded with a GPS is - on average
,- bigger than the true distance between these points. This systematic
,overestimation of distance' becomes relevant if the influence of
,"interpolation error can be neglected, which in practice is the case for"
,movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical
,explanation of this phenomenon and illustrate that it functionally
,depends on the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error (C). We argue
,that C can be interpreted as a quality measure for movement data
,recorded with a GPS. If there is a strong autocorrelation between any
,"two consecutive position estimates, they have very similar error. This"
,"error cancels out when average speed, distance or direction is"
,calculated along the trajectory. Based on our theoretical findings we
,introduce a novel approach to determine C in real-world GPS movement
,data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our approach to pedestrian
,trajectories and car trajectories. We found that the measurement error
,in the data was strongly spatially and temporally autocorrelated and
,"give a quality estimate of the data. Most importantly, our findings are"
,not limited to GPS alone. The systematic bias and its implications are
,bound to occur in any movement data collected with absolute positioning
,if interpolation error can be neglected.

AB,With the development of GPS and the popularity of smart phones and
,"wearable devices, users can easily log their daily trajectories. Prior"
,works have elaborated on mining trajectory patterns from raw
,trajectories. Trajectory patterns consist of hot regions and the
,"sequential relationships among them, where hot regions refer the spatial"
,regions with a higher density of data points. Note that some hot regions
,"do not have any meaning for users. Moreover, trajectory patterns do not"
,have explicit time information or semantic information. To enrich
,"trajectory patterns, we propose semantic trajectory patterns which are"
,"referred to as the moving patterns with spatial, temporal, and semantic"
,"attributes. Given a user trajectory, we aim at mining frequent semantic"
,"trajectory patterns. Explicitly, we extract the three attributes from a"
,"raw trajectory, and convert it into a semantic mobility sequence. Given"
,"such a semantic mobility sequence, we propose two algorithms to discover"
,"frequent semantic trajectory patterns. The first algorithm, MB (standing"
,"for matching-based algorithm), is a naive method to find frequent"
,semantic trajectory patterns. It generates all possible patterns and
,extracts the occurrence of the patterns from the semantic mobility
,"sequence. The second algorithm, PS (standing for PrefixSpan-based"
,"algorithm), is developed to efficiently mine semantic trajectory"
,"patterns. Due to the good efficiency of PrefixSpan, algorithm PS will"
,fully utilize the advantage of PrefixSpan. Since the semantic mobility
,"sequence contains three attributes, we need to further transform it into"
,"a raw sequence before using algorithm PrefixSpan. Therefore, we propose"
,the SS algorithm (standing for sequence symbolization algorithm) to
,"achieve this purpose. To evaluate our proposed algorithms, we conducted"
,"experiments on the real datasets of Google Location History, and the"
,experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our
,proposed algorithms.

AB,Floating car data (FCD) recorded with the Global Positioning System
,"(GPS) are an important data source for traffic research. However, FCD"
,"are subject to error, which can relate either to the accuracy of the"
,recordings (measurement error) or to the temporal rate at which the data
,are sampled (interpolation error). Both errors affect movement
,"parameters derived from the FCD, such as speed or direction, and"
,consequently influence conclusions drawn about the movement. In this
,paper we combined recent findings about the autocorrelation of GPS
,measurement error and well-established findings from random walk theory
,"to analyse a set of real-world FCD. First, we showed that the"
,measurement error in the FCD was affected by positive autocorrelation.
,"We explained why this is a quality measure of the data. Second, we"
,evaluated four metrics to assess the influence of interpolation error.
,We found that interpolation error strongly affects the correct
,"interpretation of the car's dynamics (speed, direction), whereas its"
,"impact on the path (travelled distance, spatial location) was moderate."
,Based on these results we gave recommendations for recording of FCD
,"using the GPS. Our recommendations only concern time-based sampling,"
,"change-based, location-based or event-based sampling are not discussed."
,The sampling approach minimizes the effects of error on movement
,parameters while avoiding the collection of redundant information. This
,is crucial for obtaining reliable results from FCD.

AB,Rooted in the philosophy of point-and segment-based approaches for
,"transportation mode segmentation of trajectories, the measures that"
,researchers have adopted to evaluate the quality of the results (1) are
,"incomparable across approaches, hence slowing the progress in the field"
,and (2) do not provide insight about the quality of the continuous
,"transportation mode segmentation. To address these problems, this paper"
,proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a
,continuous transportation mode segmentation model performs. The error
,measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous
,"intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the"
,alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the
,corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing
,errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic
,"transportation mode segmentation approaches (implicit,"
,"explicit-holistic, and explicit-consensus-based transport mode"
,"segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture."
,Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the
,"superiority of explicit-consensus-based transport mode segmentation,"
,which can be attributed to the explicit modeling of segments and
,"transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex"
,learning task.

AB,The analysis of movements frequently requires more than just
,"spatio-temporal data. Thus, despite recent progresses in trajectory"
,"handling, there is still a gap between movement data and formal"
,semantics. This gap hinders movement analyses benefiting from available
,"knowledge, with well-defined and widely agreed semantics. This article"
,describes the Baquara(2) framework to help narrow this gap by exploiting
,knowledge bases to semantically enrich and analyze movement data. It
,provides an ontological model for structuring and abstracting movement
,data in a multilevel hierarchy of progressively detailed movement
,"segments that generalize concepts such as trajectories, stops, and"
,moves. Baquara(2) also includes a general customizable process to
,annotate movement data with concepts and objects described in ontologies
,and Linked Open Data (LOD) collections. The resulting semantic
,annotations enable queries for movement analyses based on application
,and domain specific knowledge. The proposed framework has been used in
,experiments to semantically enrich movement data collected from social
,media with geo-referenced LOD. The obtained results enable powerful
,queries that illustrate Baquara(2) capabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB,The aging population is a major concern of human society in the 21st
,century. Elders who suffer physical or cognitive impairments often have
,"difficulties in navigational tasks and remembering landmarks. As such,"

,model an individual's movement trajectories as a graph based on her
,historical GPS traces. We then identify outlying trajectories that have
,a defined wandering or deviating pattern as potential instances of
,disorientation. We develop a method called iBDD that is able to detect
,two categories of outlying trajectories in a uniform framework in

AB,The emergence of cloud-based storage services is opening up new avenues
,in data exchange and data dissemination. This has amplified the interest
,in right-protection mechanisms to establish ownership in the event of
,"data leakage. Current right-protection technologies, however, rarely"
,provide strong guarantees on dataset utility after the protection
,process. This work presents techniques that explicitly address this
,topic and provably preserve the outcome of certain mining operations. In
,"particular, we take special care to guarantee that the outcome of"
,hierarchical clustering operations remains the same before and after
,right protection. Our approach considers all prevalent hierarchical
,"clustering variants: single-, complete-, and average-linkage. We imprint"
,"the ownership in a dataset using watermarking principles, and we derive"
,tight bounds on the expansion/contraction of distances incurred by the
,process. We leverage our analysis to design fast algorithms for right
,protection without exhaustively searching the vast design space.
,"Finally, because the right-protection process introduces a user-tunable"
,"distortion on the dataset, we explore the possibility of using this"
,mechanism for data obfuscation. We quantify the tradeoff between
,obfuscation and utility for spatiotemporal datasets and discover very
,favorable characteristics of the process. An additional advantage is
,that when one is interested in both right-protecting and obfuscating the
,"original data values, the proposed mechanism can accomplish both tasks"
,simultaneously.

AB,Animal coordinated movement interactions are commonly explained by
,"assuming unspecified social forces of attraction, repulsion and"
,alignment with parameters drawn from observed movement data. Here we
,propose and test a biologically realistic and quantifiable biosonar
,movement interaction mechanism for echolocating bats based on spatial
,"perceptual bias, i.e. actual sound field, a reaction delay, and observed"
,motor constraints in speed and acceleration. We found that foraging
,pairs of bats flying over a water surface swapped leader-follower roles
,and performed chases or coordinated manoeuvres by copying the heading a
,nearby individual has had up to 500 ms earlier. Our proposed mechanism
,based on the interplay between sensory-motor constraints and delayed
,alignment was able to recreate the observed spatial actor-reactor
,"patterns. Remarkably, when we varied model parameters (response delay,"
,hearing threshold and echolocation directionality) beyond those observed
,"in nature, the spatio-temporal interaction patterns created by the model"
,"only recreated the observed interactions, i.e. chases, and best matched"
,"the observed spatial patterns for just those response delays, hearing"
,thresholds and echolocation directionalities found to be used by bats.
,This supports the validity of our sensory ecology approach of movement
,"coordination, where interacting bats localise each other by active"
,echolocation rather than eavesdropping.

,"and (iii) trajectory on campus. Then, we develop a linear loss function"

AB,With the development of GPS and the popularity of smart phones and
,"wearable devices, users can easily log their daily trajectories. Prior"
,works have elaborated on mining trajectory patterns from raw
,"trajectories. However, trajectory patterns do not have explicit time"
,"information or semantic information. To enrich trajectory patterns, we"
,propose STS-TPs (standing for Spatial-Temporal Semantic Trajectory
,"Patterns) which refer to the moving patterns with spatial, temporal, and"
,"semantic attributes. Given a set of user trajectories, we aim at mining"
,"STS-TPs. Explicitly, we extract the three attributes from raw"
,"trajectories, and convert these trajectories into semantic trajectory"
,"sequences. Given a set of such semantic trajectory sequences, STS-TPs"
,could be viewed as sequential patterns with multiple attributes. To
,"fully explore the efficiency of PrefixSpan on sequential pattern mining,"
,we propose a PrefixSpan-based algorithm (abbreviated as PS) to discover
,STS-TPs. Note that the input for PrefixSpan is a set of sequences
,"consisting of items. However, each item of semantic trajectory sequences"
,"contains three attributes, and we need to further transform these"
,"sequences into symbolized sequences before using PrefixSpan. Therefore,"
,we propose two algorithms of Sequence Symbolization (SS) and Advanced
,Sequence Symbolization (ASS) to achieve this purpose. In light of
,"STS-TPs, we further propose query tasks to predict users' behaviors. To"
,"evaluate our proposed algorithms, we conducted experiments on the real"
,"datasets of Google Location History, and the experimental results show"
,the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

,"processing are performed on this erroneous data. As a result, responses"
,provided for the queries that posed by various application scenarios of

AB,The increasing availability of positioning data from mobile devices
,"facilitates new opportunities for location analytics systems, which"
,provide insights into the movement behavior of targets across various
,"localities. Similar to web analytics systems, positioning data can be"
,"utilized to count, for example, returning visitors in venues, calculate"
,"visit frequencies for certain time intervals, or to identify typical"
,movement paths for different groups of visitors inside and outside
,"buildings. However, a major challenge for location analytics is still to"
,deal with the heterogeneity of data from various positioning systems. In
,this paper we present a platform that enables location analytics as a
,service and copes with the heterogeneous spatiotemporal data of diverse
,"accuracy, frequency, and coverage. Furthermore, it allows to query large"
,positioning datasets according to various data dimensions and metrics.
,In an additional four-month field trial the applicability of our
,approach was reviewed using the example of WLAN positioning data from an

AB,Advances in location acquisition and mobile technologies led to the
,addition of the location dimension to Social Networks (SNs) and to the
,emergence of a newer class called Location-Based Social Networks
,"(LBSNs). While LBSNs are richer in their model and functions than SNs,"
,"they fail so far to attract as many users as SNs. On the other hand, SNs"
,have large amounts of geo-tagged media that are under-utilized. In this
,"paper, we propose an Interest-Aware Location-Based Recommender system"
,"(IALBR), which combines the advantages of both LBSNs and SNs, in order"
,to provide interest-aware location-based recommendations. This
,recommender system is proposed as an extension to LBSNs. It is novel in:
,(1) utilizing the geo-content in both LBSNs and SNs; (2) ranking the
,recommendations based on a novel scoring method that maps to the user
,interests. It also works for passive users who are not active content
,contributors to the LBSN. This feature is critical to increase the
,"number of LBSN users. Moreover, it helps with reducing the cold start"
,"problem, which is a common problem facing the new users of recommender"
,systems who get random unsatisfying recommendations. This is due to the
,"lack of user interest awareness, which is reliant on user history in"
,most of the recommenders. We evaluated our system with a large-scale
,"real dataset collected from foursquare with respect to precision, recall"
,and the f-measure. We also compared the results with a ground truth
,system using metrics like the normalized discounted cumulative gain and
,the mean absolute error. The results confirm that the proposed IALBR
,generates more efficient recommendations than baselines in terms of
,interest awareness.

AB,This article investigates how workout trajectories from a mobile sports
,tracking application can be used to provide automatic route suggestions
,for bicyclists. We apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method for
,"matching cycling tracks to a ""bicycle network"" extracted from"
,"crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and evaluate its effective"
,differences in terms of optimal routing compared with a simple geometric
,point-to-curve method. OSM has quickly established itself as a popular
,"resource for bicycle routing; however, its high-level of detail presents"
,challenges for its applicability to popularity-based routing. We propose
,"a solution where bikeways are prioritized in map-matching, achieving"
,good performance; the HMM-based method matched correctly on average 94%
,"of the route length. In addition, we show that the extremely biased"
,"nature of the trajectory dataset, which is typical of volunteered"
,"user-generated data, can be of high importance in terms of"
,popularity-based routing. Most computed routes diverged depending on
,whether the number of users or number of tracks was used as an indicator
,"of popularity, which may imply varying preferences among different types"
,of cyclists. Revising the number of tracks by diversity of users to
,surmount local biases in the data had a more limited effect on routing.

AB,Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to
,"help people discover attractive and interesting places, especially when"
,"users travel out of town. However, the extreme sparsity of a user-POI"
,"matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge, we"
,"propose a unified probabilistic generative model, the Topic-Region Model"
,"(TRM), to simultaneously discover the semantic, temporal, and spatial"
,"patterns of users' check-in activities, and to model their joint effect"
,on users' decision making for selection of POIs to visit. To demonstrate
,"the applicability and flexibility of TRM, we investigate how it supports"
,"two recommendation scenarios in a unified way, that is, hometown"
,recommendation and out-of- town recommendation. TRM effectively
,overcomes data sparsity by the complementarity and mutual enhancement of
,the diverse information associated with users' check-in activities
,"(e.g., check-in content, time, and location) in the processes of"
,discovering heterogeneous patterns and producing recommendations. To
,"support real-time POI recommendations, we further extend the TRM model"
,"to an online learning model, TRM-Online, to track changing user"
,"interests and speed up the model training. In addition, based on the"
,"learned model, we propose a clustering-based branch and bound algorithm"
,(CBB) to prune the POI search space and facilitate fast retrieval of the
,top-k recommendations.
,We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our
,"proposals on two real-world datasets, including recommendation"
,"effectiveness, overcoming the cold-start problem, recommendation"
,"efficiency, and model-training efficiency. The experimental results"
,"demonstrate the superiority of our TRM models, especially TRM-Online,"
,"compared with state-of-the-art competitive methods, by making more"
,"effective and efficient mobile recommendations. In addition, we study"
,the importance of each type of pattern in the two recommendation
,"scenarios, respectively, and find that exploiting temporal patterns is"
,"most important for the hometown recommendation scenario, while the"
,semantic patterns play a dominant role in improving the recommendation
,effectiveness for out-of-town users.

AB,"Location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Facebook,"
,"Foursquare, Brightkite, and so on, have attracted millions of users to"
,share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins in the
,past few years. Plenty of valuable information is accumulated based on
,"the check-in behaviors, which makes it possible to learn users' moving"
,"patterns as well as their preferences. In LBSNs, point-of-interest (POI)"
,recommendation is one of the most significant tasks because it can help
,targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party
,developers provide personalized services. Matrix factorization is a
,promising method for this task because it can capture users' preferences
,to locations and is widely adopted in traditional recommender systems
,"such as movie recommendation. However, the sparsity of the check-in data"
,makes it difficult to capture users' preferences accurately.
,Geographical influence can help alleviate this problem and have a large
,impact on the final recommendation result. By studying users' moving
,"patterns, we find that users tend to check in around several centers and"
,"different users have different numbers of centers. Based on this, we"
,propose a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM) to capture this pattern via
,"modeling the probability of a user's check-in on a location. Moreover,"
,users are usually more interested in the top 20 or even top 10
,"recommended POIs, which makes personalized ranking important in this"
,"task. From previous work, directly optimizing for pairwise ranking like"
,Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) achieves better performance in the
,top-k recommendation than directly using matrix matrix factorization
,that aims to minimize the point-wise rating error. To consider users'
,"preferences, geographical influence and personalized ranking, we propose"
,"a unified POI recommendation framework, which unifies all of them"
,"together. Specifically, we first fuse MGM with matrix factorization"
,methods and further with BPR using two different approaches. We conduct
,"experiments on Gowalla and Foursquare datasets, which are two"
,large-scale real-world LBSN datasets publicly available online. The
,results on both datasets show that our unified POI recommendation
,framework can produce better performance.

AB,Telecommunication (telco) operators aim to provide users with optimized

,"experience while retaining profit. To do this, knowing the changing"
,behavior patterns of users through their activity levels in advance can
,be a great help for operators to adjust theirmanagement strategies and
,"reduce operational risk. To achieve this goal, the operators canmake use"

,"this article, we report our research in a real-world telco setting"
,involving more than one million telco users. Our novel contribution
,includes representing users as documents containing a collection of
,"changing spatiotemporal ""words"" that express user behavior. By"
,"extracting users' space-time access records in MBB data, we use latent"
,Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn user-specific compact topic features
,for user activity level prediction. We propose a scalable online
,expectation-maximization (OEM) algorithm that can scale LDA to massive
,"MBB data, which is significantly faster than several state-of-the-art"
,"online LDA algorithms. Using these real-world MBB data, we confirm high"
,"performance in user activity level prediction. In addition, we show that"
,the inferred topics indicate that future activity level anomalies
,correlate highly with early skewed bandwidth supply and demand
,"relations. Thus, our prediction system can also guide the telco"
,operators to balance the telecommunication network in terms of

AB,Location-based social networks (LBSNs) make it possible for servers to
,"record users' location histories, mine their life patterns, and infer"

,systems gained popularity in recent years. Recommender systems can
,automatically list candidate locations for users according to their

,"However, making effective recommendations suffers from data sparsity. In"
,"order to relieve this problem and achieve high effectiveness, we take"

,we can make recommendations even on the condition that users are in a

,approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale Foursquare dataset.

,geometric fitting in computer vision. Solving the problem exactly is
,"computationally demanding, and the effort required increases rapidly"

,"Specifically, before conducting global optimization, we attempt to"
,"remove data that are provably true outliers, i.e., those that do not"

,mixed integer linear programming to perform the removal. The result of

AB,Locating smartphone users will enable numerous potential applications
,"such as monitoring customers in shopping malls. However, conventional"
,received signal strength (RSS)-based room-level localization methods are
,not likely to distinguish neighboring zones accurately due to similar
,RSS fingerprints. We solve this problem by proposing a system called
,feature-based room-level localization (FRL). FRL is based on an
,observation that different rooms vary in internal structures and human
,activities which can be reflected by RSS fluctuation ranges and user
,dwell time respectively. These two features combing with RSS can be
,exploited to improve the localization accuracy. To enable localization
,"of unmodified smartphones, FRL utilizes probe requests, which are"
,periodically broadcast by smartphones to discover nearby access points
,(APs). Experiments indicate that FRL can reliably locate users in
,"neighboring zones and achieve a 10% accuracy gain, compared with"
,conventional methods like the histogram method.

TI,Context-aware Location Recommendations with Tensor Factorization
SO,2016 IEEE/CIC INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS IN CHINA (ICCC)
PD,2016
PY,2016
AB,Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users not only to record
,where and when they go using check-ins but also to publish their ratings
,and comments of these locations. All information can be utilized to
,infer users' interests and to generate personalized location
,"recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal"
,"context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary"
,greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time.
,"Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation"
,"scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific,"
,we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional
,"tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location"
,feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the
,prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition
,"process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can"
,"obtain any user's rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we"
,partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold
,Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations. We
,evaluate our method in a real-world dataset and the results demonstrate
,the effectiveness of our method.

AB,Service recommendation for Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) has
,been received much attention mainly in the field of large-scale Wireless
,Communication Networks. It is a promising solution to guarantee service
,reliability and improve quality of experience (QoE) of users. Many
,schemes have been proposed to provide the reliable and personalized
,"services for users, such as collaborative filtering (CF), content-based"
,"recommendation(CBR), and context-aware recommendation, etc. However, the"
,"activity sequence and type popularity is lacked in above researches,"
,which leads to the recommendation accuracy and service experience
,"decline. In this paper, we propose TopSim-TP, a novel"
,trajectory-pattern-based similar users discovery method aiming to
,"effectively mine the life cycle and preference of users. First, we"
,describe the mobile behavior of users by mapping location information
,"into type information. Then, we model the trajectory-pattern for each"
,"user. Finally, we present a Common Trajectory-Pattern (CTP) extraction"
,algorithm and compute the similarity of sequences to find the top-k
,similar users for current user. The experimental results show that our
,method outperforms the existing method.

AB,Social sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm for smart
,cities where a crowd of social sources (humans or devices on their
,behalf) collectively contribute a large amount of observations about the
,physical world. This paper focuses on an interesting place finding
,problem in social sensing where the goal is to accurately identify the
,interesting places in a city where people may have strong interests to
,"visit (e.g., parks, museums, historic sites, scenic trails, etc.)."
,Solving this problem is not trivial because (i) many interesting places
,are not necessarily frequently visited by the average people and hence
,less likely to be found by the traditional recommendation systems; (ii)
,the user's social connections could directly affect their visiting
,behavior and the interestingness judgment of a given place. In this
,"paper, we develop a new Social-aware Interesting Place Finding (SIPF)"
,approach that solves the above problem by explicitly incorporating both
,the user's travel experience and social relationship into a rigorous
,analytical framework. The evaluation results showed that the new
,approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts using two
,real-world datasets collected from location-based social network
,service.

AB,The growing use of Location Based Social Networks especially in recent

,transactions attract many data mining researchers to infer various
,"information from them. In this paper, a geographic business prediction"
,"technique is proposed, which infers business usage by exploiting data"
,published about venues in Location Based Social Networks. The proposed
,technique is beneficial for investors and business decision makers. The
,proposed geo-business prediction technique considers spatial and
,categorical factors in the prediction process. Both factors affect the
,prediction accuracy rather than using traditional spatial prediction
,"techniques, which are usually used where only the location feature is"
,"involved in the prediction process. Additionally, an outlier filter is"
,proposed and applied to the data to avoid extreme values involvement in
,the prediction process in order to achieve better prediction accuracy.
,"To test the proposed technique, an experimental case study is"
,implemented. It uses data extracted from Foursquare about business
,venues in Texas State in the United States of America. The proposed geo
,business prediction technique has shown to provide better prediction
,accuracy than k nearest neighbor spatial prediction. The Application of
,"the outlier filter, results in even higher prediction accuracy for the"

AB,Location-based services allow users to perform geospatial recording
,"actions, which facilitates the mining of the moving activities of human"
,beings. This article proposes to recommend time-sensitive trip routes
,consisting of a sequence of locations with associated timestamps based
,on knowledge extracted from large-scale timestamped location sequence
,"data (e.g., check-ins and GPS traces). We argue that a good route should"
,"consider (a) the popularity of places, (b) the visiting order of places,"
,"(c) the proper visiting time of each place, and (d) the proper transit"
,"time from one place to another. By devising a statistical model, we"
,integrate these four factors into a route goodness function that aims to
,"measure the quality of a route. Equipped with the route goodness, we"
,recommend time-sensitive routes for two scenarios. The first is about
,constructing the route based on the user-specified source location with
,the starting time. The second is about composing the route between the
,specified source location and the destination location given a starting
,"time. To handle these queries, we propose a search method, Guidance"
,"Search, which consists of a novel heuristic satisfaction function that"
,guides the search toward the destination location and a backward
,checking mechanism to boost the effectiveness of the constructed route.
,Experiments on the Gowalla check-in datasets demonstrate the
,effectiveness of our model on detecting real routes and performing cloze
,"test of routes, comparing with other baseline methods. We also develop a"
,system TripRouter as a real-time demo platform.

AB,Providing better travel services for tourists is one of the important
,applications in urban computing. Though many recommender systems have
,"been developed for enhancing the quality of travel service, most of them"
,lack a systematic and open framework to dynamically incorporate multiple
,"types of additional context information existing in the tourism domain,"
,"such as the travel area, season, and price of travel packages. To that"
,"end, in this article, we propose an open framework, the"
,"Objected-Oriented Recommender System (ORS), for the developers"
,performing personalized travel package recommendations to tourists. This
,framework has the ability to import all the available additional context
,information to the travel package recommendation process in a
,"cost-effective way. Specifically, the different types of additional"
,information are extracted and uniformly represented as feature-value
,"pairs. Then, we define the Object, which is the collection of the"
,feature-value pairs. We propose two models that can be used in the ORS
,framework for extracting the implicit relationships among Objects. The
,Objected-Oriented Topic Model (OTM) can extract the topics conditioned
,on the intrinsic feature-value pairs of the Objects. The
,Objected-Oriented Bayesian Network (OBN) can effectively infer the
,cotravel probability of two tourists by calculating the co-occurrence
,time of feature-value pairs belonging to different kinds of Objects.
,"Based on the relationships mined by OTM or OBN, the recommendation list"
,"is generated by the collaborative filtering method. Finally, we evaluate"
,these two models and the ORS framework on real-world travel package
,"data, and the experimental results show that the ORS framework is more"
,"flexible in terms of incorporating additional context information, and"
,thus leads to better performances for travel package recommendations.
,"Meanwhile, for feature selection in ORS, we define the feature"
,"information entropy, and the experimental results demonstrate that using"
,features with lower entropies usually leads to better recommendation
,results.

AB,Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized many people's lives but
,"also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy"
,"consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues"
,"by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow,"
,"human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban"
,"sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a"
,recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of
,"people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban"
,computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet
,"conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil"
,"engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context"
,of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban
,"computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the"
,"perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications"
,"of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning,"
,"transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public"
,"safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each"
,"category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed"
,"in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban"
,"data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban"
,"data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban"
,"computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in"

AB,Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer
,users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services
,usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names
,automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context
,"for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we"
,proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically
,provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In
,"particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her"
,"physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate"
,"semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location"
,"naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to"
,propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location
,"naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial"
,"preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging"
,"learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of"
,"5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from"
,Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three
,"components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus"
,it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as
,"discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated"
,"with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP"
,outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names
,"for 23.6% and 26.6% of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai,"
,respectively.

AB,This paper proposes a novel fully distributed and collaborative
,k-anonymity protocol (LPAF) to protect users' location information and
,ensure better privacy while forwarding queries/replies to/from untrusted
,location-based service (LBS) over opportunistic mobile networks
,(OppMNets). We utilize a lightweight multihop Markov-based stochastic
,model for location prediction to guide queries toward the LBS's location
,and to reduce required resources in terms of retransmission overheads.
,We develop a formal analytical model and present theoretical analysis
,and simulation of the proposed protocol performance. We further validate
,our results by performing extensive simulation experiments over a
,pseudorealistic city map using map-based mobility models and using
,real-world data trace to compare LPAF to existing location privacy and
,benchmark protocols. We show that LPAF manages to keep higher privacy
,levels in terms of k-anonymity and quality of service in terms of
,"success ratio and delay, as compared with other protocols, while"
,maintaining lower overheads. Simulation results show that LPAF achieves
,"up to an 11% improvement in success ratio for pseudorealistic scenarios,"
,whereas real-world data trace experiments show up to a 24% improvement
,with a slight increase in the average delay.

AB,The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in
,"recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between"
,users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS
,trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie
,"between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations."
,Different from previous work using social structures or directly
,"matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS"
,"trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping"
,"malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between"
,different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm.
,"The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries"
,more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic
,"positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two"
,"users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in"
,"different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential"
,"property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We"
,evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109
,users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a
,physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several
,widely used sequence matching approaches given this application
,scenario.

AB,Credit card is a popular payment method and the transaction data keeps
,track of purchasing activities in people's daily lives. Extracting
,location of people's activities is an important task in many data mining
,problems because it may greatly help improve user experience and the
,service provided to people. Locating people from credit card
,transactions is equivalent to determining the location of every POS
,terminal where a payment takes place. This is however not an easy task
,because the locations of terminals are not usually provided to the
,credit card issuing companies and only a few terminals can be
,unambiguously located through map service by providing the merchants'
,names.
,"In this paper, we propose a system to infer the locations of POS"
,terminals using transaction data and map service. We first construct a
,transaction graph where the nodes are POS terminals. We then propose a
,two phase algorithm to find out uncertain and unknown locations of the
,"terminals. In the first phase, we try to eliminate the uncertainty of"
,POS terminals with multiple candidate locations. We show this problem is
,NP-hard and then give an effective heuristic algorithm to solve it. In
,"the second phase, we compute the locations of unknown POS terminals by"
,propagating the locations of known ones with spatial-temporal
,constraints. The algorithm is evaluated using a real-world credit card
,transaction data set and the result is promising for business
,applications.

TI,Service Rating Prediction by Exploring Social Mobile Users' Geographical
,Locations
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIG DATA
AB,"Recently, advances in intelligent mobile device and positioning techniques have fundamentally enhanced social networks, which allows users to share their experiences, reviews, ratings, photos, check-ins, etc. The geographical information located by smart phone bridges the gap between physical and digital worlds. Location data functions as the connection between user's physical behaviors and virtual social networks structured by the smart phone or web services. We refer to these social networks involving geographical information as location-based social networks (LBSNs). Such information brings opportunities and challenges for recommender systems to solve the cold start, sparsity problem of datasets and rating prediction. In this paper, we make full use of the mobile users' location sensitive characteristics to carry out rating prediction. We mine: 1) the relevance between user's ratings and user-item geographical location distances, called as user-item geographical connection, 2) the relevance between users' rating differences and user-user geographical location distances, called as user-user geographical connection. It is discovered that humans' rating behaviors are affected by geographical location significantly. Moreover, three factors: user-item geographical connection, user-user geographical connection, and interpersonal interest similarity, are fused into a unified rating prediction model. We conduct a series of experiments on a real social rating network dataset Yelp. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models."

TI,Collaborative location recommendations with dynamic time periods
SO,PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB,"This study proposes a location-based collaborative filtering recommendation system with dynamic time periods (LCFDTPs) for recommending timely and suitable points of interest (POIs) to mobile users. The system expedites calculating similarity based on POI recency and enables mobile users to promptly obtain recommended items that closely match their current space-time conditions by selecting different strategies for dissimilar situations. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated through simulations. The simulation results revealed that compared with three existing strategies, the proposed LCFDTP system demonstrated higher recommendation accuracy and coverage and a shorter average recommendation time. When the users' moving velocity was set to 50 km/h and the query radius was set to 2 km, the recommendation precision of the proposed system was 61% higher than those of the other strategies. Moreover, the recommendation coverage and average response time of the LCFDTP system were 9% higher and 62% shorter than those of the other compared strategies, respectively. The LCFDTP system can also improve the POI recommendation quality by applying location-based services, thus enhancing user satisfaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

SO,KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
AB,"Recent advancements in location-based recommendation system (LBRS) and the availability of online applications, such as Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Path, and Facebook have introduced new research challenges in the area of LBRS. Use of content, such as geo-tagged media, point location-based, and trajectory-based information help in connecting the gap between the online social networking services and the physical world. In this article, we present a systematic review of the scientific literature of LBRS and summarize the efforts and contributions proposed in the literature. We have performed a qualitative comparison of the existing techniques used in the area of LBRS. We present the basic filtration techniques used in LBRS followed by a discussion on the services and the location features the LBRS utilizes to perform the recommendations. The classification of criteria for recommendations and evaluation metrics are also presented. We have critically investigated the techniques proposed in the literature for LBRS and extracted the challenges and promising research topics for future work."

AB,"As one of the key features of social networks, friends recommendation is a kind of link prediction task with ranking that was extensively investigated recently in the area of social networks analysis as users would like to follow people who have similar interests to them. We use Twitter as a case study and propose a novel hybrid friends recommendation framework that is not only based on friends relationship but also users' location information, which are recorded by Twitter when they posted their tweets. Our framework can recommend friends to users who have similar interests based on location features by using collaborative filtering to effectively filter out those common places which are meaningless, e.g., bus station; and focuses on those places that have high probability that people are there more likely to become friends, e.g., dance studio. In addition, we propose a multiple classifiers combination method to leverage the information contained in friends and locations features in order to get better outcomes. We evaluate our framework on two real corpora from Twitter, and the favorable results indicate that our proposed approach is feasible."

AB,"Friend recommendation is a critical task in social networks. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Personalized Ranking Deep Neural Network (BayDNN) model for friend recommendation in social networks. BayDNN first extracts latent structural patterns from the input network data and then use the Bayesian ranking to make friend recommendations. With BayDNN we achieve significant performance improvement on two public datasets: Epinions and Slashdot. For example, on Epinions dataset, BayDNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, with a 5% improvement on NDCG over the best baseline."
,"The advantages of the proposed BayDNN mainly come from a novel Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) idea, which precisely captures the users' personal bias based on the extracted deep features, and its underlying convolutional neural network (CNN), which offers a mechanism to extract latent deep structural feature representations of the complicated network data. To get good parameter estimation for the neural network, we present a fine-tuned pre-training strategy for the proposed BayDNN model based on Poisson and Bernoulli probabilistic models."

TI,Mining Efficient Taxi Operation Strategies From Large Scale Geo-Location
,Data
SO,IEEE ACCESS
AB,"Taxi drivers always look for strategies to locate passengers quickly and therefore increase their profit margin. In reality, the passenger seeking strategies are mostly empirical and substantially vary among taxi drivers. From the history taxi data, the top performing taxi drivers can earn 25% more than the ones with mediocre seeking strategy in the same period of time. A better strategy not only helps taxi drivers earn more with less effort, but also reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. It is interesting to examine the influential factors in passenger seeking strategies and find algorithms to guide taxi drivers to passenger hotspots with the right timing. With the abundant availability of history taxicab traces, the existing methods of doing taxi business have been radically changed. This paper focuses on the problem of mining efficient operation strategies from a large-scale history taxi traces collected over one year. Our approach presents generic insights into the dynamics of taxicab services with the objective of maximizing the profit margins for the concerned parties. We propose important metrics, such as trip frequency, hot spots, and taxi mileage, and provide valuable insights toward more efficient operation strategies. We analyze these metrics using techniques, such as Newton's polynomial interpolation and Gamma distribution, to understand their dynamics. Our strategies use the real taxicab traces from the city of Changsha (P.R.China), may predict the taxi rides at different times by 90.68% per day, and increase the taxi drivers income levels up to 19.38% by controlling appropriate mileage per trip and following the route across more urban hot spots."

AB,"People connect to each other over conventional online social networks (OSNs) based on many parameters (common interests, experiences, locations), while the anonymous social networks (ASNs) recommend candidate friends to a user mainly by the location proximity at a coarse-granularity. In this paper, we formulate a fine-grained trajectory-matching prediction problem for friend recommendation in ASNs-what is the likelihood for two users to encounter with each other in the future based on their historical trajectory data? We define the serendipity of two trajectories in both spatial and temporal domains to quantify the similarity between two users' trajectories, and propose an algorithm that recommends candidate friends to a user by determining the similarity of their trajectories. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm can predict the encounter of users quite accurately and it outperforms the conventional algorithms in terms of the precision and consumed time."

This method has large amount of travel data including different places, the distributions of cost, visiting time and visiting season of each topic is mined to bridge the gap between user travel preference and travel routes and we also have topical package space. Here we use advantage of the complementary social media: community-contributed photos and map both user interests and travel data descriptions to the topical package space to get user topical package model and route. Representative images with viewpoint and seasonal diversity of POIs are shown to offer a more extensive impression."

This feature would help service providers, to personalize the marketing campaigns and to enhance other problems results, such as the next location prediction. In order to solve this task, we divided it into two subtasks; first, to develop a model for novelty prediction, second to use its results to predict the next location. The predication task considers two cases of prediction; regular places (visited before) and novel places (never visited before). The predication accuracy of the proposed approach yields high accuracy of 86.7%, for regular places and an accuracy of 38.4% for novel places."

The state of the art in this case is mainly focused on classical smart city solution for informing the city users and or for engaging them with specific wired rules toward virtuous models. And not using flexible languages and predictive models, pushing them towards a larger range of virtuous habits. On this regards, the main problems are the computation of user behavior via data analytic (semantic computing, machine learning), as well as the formalization of strategies via simple and well formalized language for producing engagements to the city users, which can be understood by city operators. In this paper, a solution for city users engagement is studied and implemented for Sii-Mobility Smart city national project in Italy has been presented. The solution has been implemented thanks to the exploitation of Km4City model and semantic computing. The paper also presents the validation of results about the effective usage of the solution by providing some statistical evidence about the efficient assessment of user behavior and of engagement rules acceptance rate."

AB,"Given increased access to a stream of data collected by location acquisition technologies, the potential of GPS trajectory data is waiting to be realized in various application domains relevant to urban informatics-namely in understanding travel behavior, estimating carbon emission from vehicles, and further building healthy and sustainable cities. Partitioning GPS trajectories into meaningful elements is crucial to improve the performance of further analysis. We propose a method for detecting a stay point (where an individual stays for a while) using a density-based spatial clustering algorithm where temporal criterion and gaps are also taken into account. The proposed method fills gaps using linear interpolation, and identifies a stay point that meets two criteria (spatial density and time duration). To evaluate the proposed method, we compare the number of stay points detected from the proposed method to that of stay points identified by manual inspection. Evaluation is performed on 9 weeks of trajectory data. Results show that clustering-based stay point detection combined with gap treatment can reliably detect stop episodes. Further, comparison of performance between using the method with versus without gap treatment indicates that gap treatment improves the performance of the clustering-based stay point detection."

Implicit ratings of users for tourist spots are mined using GPS trajectory logs. GA is used to evolve ratings of unvisited spots using implicit ratings. GPS trajectory dataset of 178 users collected by Microsoft Research Asia's GeoLife project is used for the purpose of evaluation and experiments.

TI,A Conditioned Behavioral Paradigm for Assessing Onset and Lasting
,Tinnitus in Rats
SO,PLOS ONE
AB,"Numerous behavioral paradigms have been developed to assess tinnitus-like behavior in animals. Nevertheless, they are often limited by prolonged training requirements, as well as an inability to simultaneously assess onset and lasting tinnitus behavior, tinnitus pitch or duration, or tinnitus presence without grouping data from multiple animals or testing sessions. To enhance behavioral testing of tinnitus, we developed a conditioned licking suppression paradigm to determine the pitch(s) of both onset and lasting tinnitus-like behavior within individual animals. Rats learned to lick water during broadband or narrowband noises, and to suppress licking to avoid footshocks during silence. After noise exposure, rats significantly increased licking during silent trials, suggesting onset tinnitus-like behavior. Lasting tinnitus-behavior, however, was exhibited in about half of noise-exposed rats through 7 weeks post-exposure tested. Licking activity during narrowband sound trials remained unchanged following noise exposure, while ABR hearing thresholds fully recovered and were comparable between tinnitus((+)) and tinnitus((-)) rats. To assess another tinnitus inducer, rats were injected with sodium salicylate. They demonstrated high pitch tinnitus-like behavior, but later recovered by 5 days post-injection. Further control studies showed that 1): sham noise-exposed rats tested with footshock did not exhibit tinnitus-like behavior, and 2): noise-exposed or sham rats tested without footshocks showed no fundamental changes in behavior compared to those tested with shocks. Together, these results demonstrate that this paradigm can efficiently test the development of noise-and salicylate-induced tinnitus behavior. The ability to assess tinnitus individually, over time, and without averaging data enables us to realistically address tinnitus in a clinically relevant way. Thus, we believe that this optimized behavioral paradigm will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms of tinnitus and development of effective treatments."

TI,Context-Aware Location Recommendation Using Geotagged Photos in Social
,Media
SO,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB,"Recently, the increasing availability of digital cameras and the rapid advances in social media have led to the accumulation of a large number of geotagged photos, which may reflect people's travel experiences in different cities and can be used to generate location recommendations for tourists. Research on this aspect mainly focused on providing personalized recommendations matching a tourist's travel preferences, while ignoring the context of the visit (e.g., weather, season and time of the day) that potentially influences his/her travel behavior. This article explores context-aware methods to provide location recommendations matching a tourist's travel preferences and visiting context. Specifically, we apply clustering methods to detect touristic locations and extract travel histories from geotagged photos on Flickr. We then propose a novel context similarity measure to quantify the similarity between any two contexts and develop three context-aware collaborative filtering methods, i.e., contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering and modeling. With these methods, location recommendations like in similar contexts, other tourists similar to you often visited ... can be provided to the current user. Results of the evaluation with a publicly-available Flickr photo collection show that these methods are able to provide a tourist with location recommendations matching his/her travel preferences and visiting context. More importantly, compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed methods, which employ the introduced context similarity measure, can provide tourists with significantly better recommendations. While Flickr data have been used in this study, these context-aware collaborative filtering (CaCF) methods can also be extended for other kinds of travel histories, such as GPS trajectories and Foursquare check-ins, to provide context-aware recommendations."

TI,TICRec: A Probabilistic Framework to Utilize Temporal Influence
,Correlations for Time-Aware Location Recommendations
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING
AB,"In location-based social networks (LBSNs), time significantly affects users' check-in behaviors, for example, people usually visit different places at different times of weekdays and weekends, e.g., restaurants at noon on weekdays and bars at midnight on weekends. Current studies use the temporal influence to recommend locations through dividing users' check-in locations into time slots based on their check-in time and learning their preferences to locations in each time slot separately. Unfortunately, these studies generally suffer from two major limitations: (1) the loss of time information because of dividing a day into time slots and (2) the lack of temporal influence correlations due to modeling users' preferences to locations for each time slot separately. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework called TICRec that utilizes temporal influence correlations (TIC) of both weekdays and weekends for time-aware location recommendations. TICRec not only recommends locations to users, but it also suggests when a user should visit a recommended location. In TICRec, we estimate a time probability density of a user visiting a new location without splitting the continuous time into discrete time slots to avoid the time information loss. To leverage the TIC, TICRec considers both user-based TIC (i.e., different users' check-in behaviors to the same location at different times) and location-based TIC (i.e., the same user's check-in behaviors to different locations at different times). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for TICRec using two real data sets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla. Experimental results show that TICRec achieves significantly superior location recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art recommendation techniques with temporal influence."

TI,POI recommendation through cross-region collaborative filtering
SO,KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB,"Recommending points of interest (POIs) to a user according to the user's current location and past check-in activities is the focus in this paper. Previously proposed probabilistic and topic model-based methods predict the POIs based on the distribution of the POIs visited in the past, assuming that the next POI for the user follows the same distribution. Such methods tend to recommend the POIs in the cities or regions that the user has visited before because only such cities or regions have observed ratings for the user. Thus, these works are not suitable for a user who travels to a new city or region where she has not checked-in any POI previously. To address this issue, we distinguish the user preferences on the content of POIs from the user preferences on the POIs themselves. The former is long term and is independent of where POIs are located, and the latter is short term and is constrained by the proximity of the location of the POI and the user's current location. This distinction motivates a location-independent modeling of user's content preferences of POIs, and a location-aware modeling of user's location preferences of POIs. The final recommendation of POIs is derived by combining the predicted rating on content and the predicted rating on location of POI. We evaluate this method using the Yelp and Foursquare data sets. This approach has superiority over the state-of-the-art and works well in the ""new city"" situation in which the user has not rated any of the POIs in the current region."

TI,Trajectory data mining: A review of methods and applications
SO,JOURNAL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB,"The increasing use of location-aware devices has led to an increasing availability of trajectory data. As a result, researchers devoted their efforts to developing analysis methods including different data mining methods for trajectories. However, the research in this direction has so far produced mostly isolated studies and we still lack an integrated view of problems in applications of trajectory mining that were solved, the methods used to solve them, and applications using the obtained solutions. In this paper, we first discuss generic methods of trajectory mining and the relationships between them. Then, we discuss and classify application problems that were solved using trajectory data and relate them to the generic mining methods that were used and real world applications based on them. We classify trajectory-mining application problems under major problem groups based on how they are related. This classification of problems can guide researchers in identifying new application problems. The relationships between the methods together with the association between the application problems and mining methods can help researchers in identifying gaps between methods and inspire them to develop new methods. This paper can also guide analysts in choosing a suitable method for a specific problem. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an integrated view relating applications of mining trajectory data and the methods used."

AB,"The location-based social networks introduce a platform to understand the users' preferences. In general, the users of the social networks promote the exchange of data within their own networks. Such data are being used in the literature for a wide variety of location-aware recommendation systems. We investigate the role of amalgamation of real-time GPS logs, and historical check-in data in developing a restaurant recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a novel location, time and preference aware restaurant recommendation method using the users' current geospatial location, historical check-in data of the users, and the time of the recommendation request. In the proposed method, users' check-in histories are analyzed individually to discover users' visiting trends, food preference trends, and overall popularity of the restaurants. At the same time, each restaurant's operation time and the distance are modeled separately to compute recommendation scores of the restaurants. The recommendation scores are computed by considering four key factors, namely, i) user's preference scores, ii) the distance of the restaurants, iii) the time of a day, and iv) the popularity scores of the restaurants. Each of these key factors is modeled carefully to estimate realistic recommendation scores for the restaurants in a given geospatial range. We tested our proposed method using an available online dataset. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method."

As an important component of LBSNs, recommender systems gained popularity in recent years. Recommender systems can automatically list candidate locations for users according to their preferences, which is different from traditional search methods. However, making effective recommendations suffers from data sparsity. In order to relieve this problem and achieve high effectiveness, we take context information into consideration and present a personalized location recommender system considering both user preference and local features in this paper. To be specific, we apply Labeled-LDA in user preference learning and local features inference processes, which are denoted as UL-LDA model and CL-LDA model, respectively. Because of this, we can make recommendations even on the condition that users are in a new city and have little information about the city. We evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale Foursquare dataset. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach."

Location Based Social Networks can provide such large amounts of data that can be used in urban analysis to understand business behaviors. Towards more insight for business behavior, a novel analytical prespective that exploits data collected from Location Based Social Networks is introduced to predict business turnouts. Prediction is implemented using machine learning techniques. Spatial regression models are investigated through a comparative study to model the dataset features relationships for business behavior prediction. Geographically Weighted Regression model is found to be the most appropriate in predicting business turnouts of objects provided by Location Based Social Networks. Moreover, a Partitioned Geographically Weighted Regression model is proposed to deal with the data heterogeneity nature pursuing more accurate predictions for the business turnouts. An experimental case study, using data about venues registered in Foursquare is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods. The experimental results confirm the best performance by the Geographically Weighted Regression compared to Durbin, Durbin Error, Spatial Lag, Spatial Error, and Spatial Lag X regression models presented in this study. Moreover, the proposed Partitioned Geographically Weighted Regression model experimental results showed better prediction accuracy compared to the classical Geographically Weighted Regression model."

We build an empirical model of social link creation that incorporates individual characteristics and pairwise user similarities. Specifically, we define four user proximity measures from biography, geography, mobility, and short messages. To construct proximity from unstructured text information, we build topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Using Gowalla data with 385,306 users, 3 million locations, and 35 million check-in records, we empirically estimate the model to find evidence on the homophily effect on network formation. To cope with possible endogeneity issues, we use exogenous weather shocks as our instrumental variables and find the empirical results are robust: network formation decisions are significantly affected by our proximity measures."

All information can be utilized to infer users' interests and to generate personalized location recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific, we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can obtain any user's rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations.

The fundamental problem of what information is delivered with which vehicle(s), however, has not been adequately studied. We propose an innovative cloud-assisted architecture to facilitate intelligent information dissemination among vehicles. Within the novel architecture, virtual social connections between vehicles are created and maintained on the cloud. Vehicles with similar driving histories are considered friends in a vehicular social network (VSN). The closeness of the relation between two vehicles in a VSN is then modeled by the three-valued subjective logic model. Based on the closeness between vehicles, only relevant information will be delivered to vehicles that are likely interested in it. The cloud-assisted architecture coordinates vehicular social connection construction, VSN maintenance, vehicle closeness assessment, and information dissemination."

TI,Spatiotemporal Sequential Influence Modeling for Location
,Recommendations: A Gravity-based Approach
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"Recommending to users personalized locations is an important feature of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), which benefits users who wish to explore new places and businesses to discover potential customers. In LBSNs, social and geographical influences have been intensively used in location recommendations. However, human movement also exhibits spatiotemporal sequential patterns, but only a few current studies consider the spatiotemporal sequential influence of locations on users' check-in behaviors. In this article, we propose a new gravity model for location recommendations, called LORE, to exploit the spatiotemporal sequential influence on location recommendations. First, LORE extracts sequential patterns from historical check-in location sequences of all users as a Location-Location Transition Graph (L(2)TG), and utilizes the L(2)TG to predict the probability of a user visiting a new location through the developed additive Markov chain that considers the effect of all visited locations in the check-in history of the user on the new location. Furthermore, LORE applies our contrived gravity model to weigh the effect of each visited location on the new location derived from the personalized attractive force (i.e., the weight) between the visited location and the new location. The gravity model effectively integrates the spatiotemporal, social, and popularity influences by estimating a power-law distribution based on (i) the spatial distance and temporal difference between two consecutive check-in locations of the same user, (ii) the check-in frequency of social friends, and (iii) the popularity of locations from all users. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for LORE using three large-scale real-world datasets collected from Foursquare, Gowalla, and Brightkite. Experimental results show that LORE achieves significantly superior location recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art location recommendation techniques."

TI,iGeoRec: A Personalized and Efficient Geographical Location
,Recommendation Framework
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING
AB,"Geographical influence has been intensively exploited for location recommendations in location-based social networks (LBSNs) due to the fact that geographical proximity significantly affects users' check-in behaviors. However, current studies only model the geographical influence on all users' check-in behaviors as a universal way. We argue that the geographical influence on users' check-in behaviors should be personalized. In this paper, we propose a personalized and efficient geographical location recommendation framework called iGeoRec to take full advantage of the geographical influence on location recommendations. In iGeoRec, there are mainly two challenges: (1) personalizing the geographical influence to accurately predict the probability of a user visiting a new location, and (2) efficiently computing the probability of each user to all new locations. To address these two challenges, (1) we propose a probabilistic approach to personalize the geographical influence as a personal distribution for each user and predict the probability of a user visiting any new location using her personal distribution. Furthermore, (2) we develop an efficient approximation method to compute the probability of any user to all new locations; the proposed method reduces the computational complexity of the exact computation method from O(vertical bar L vertical bar n(3)) to O(vertical bar L vertical bar n) (where vertical bar L vertical bar is the total number of locations in an LBSN and n is the number of check-in locations of a user). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the recommendation accuracy and efficiency of iGeoRec using two large-scale real data sets collected from the two of the most popular LBSNs: Foursquare and Gowalla. Experimental results show that iGeoRec provides significantly superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art geographical recommendation techniques."

TI,Recommendations in location-based social networks: a survey
SO,GEOINFORMATICA
AB,"Recent advances in localization techniques have fundamentally enhanced social networking services, allowing users to share their locations and location-related contents, such as geo-tagged photos and notes. We refer to these social networks as location-based social networks (LBSNs). Location data bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds and enables a deeper understanding of users' preferences and behavior. This addition of vast geo-spatial datasets has stimulated research into novel recommender systems that seek to facilitate users' travels and social interactions. In this paper, we offer a systematic review of this research, summarizing the contributions of individual efforts and exploring their relations. We discuss the new properties and challenges that location brings to recommender systems for LBSNs. We present a comprehensive survey analyzing 1) the data source used, 2) the methodology employed to generate a recommendation, and 3) the objective of the recommendation. We propose three taxonomies that partition the recommender systems according to the properties listed above. First, we categorize the recommender systems by the objective of the recommendation, which can include locations, users, activities, or social media. Second, we categorize the recommender systems by the methodologies employed, including content-based, link analysis-based, and collaborative filtering-based methodologies. Third, we categorize the systems by the data sources used, including user profiles, user online histories, and user location histories. For each category, we summarize the goals and contributions of each system and highlight the representative research effort. Further, we provide comparative analysis of the recommender systems within each category. Finally, we discuss the available data-sets and the popular methods used to evaluate the performance of recommender systems. Finally, we point out promising research topics for future work. This article presents a panorama of the recommender systems in location-based social networks with a balanced depth, facilitating research into this important research theme."

TI,Trajectory Data Mining: An Overview
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"The advances in location-acquisition and mobile computing techniques have generated massive spatial trajectory data, which represent the mobility of a diversity of moving objects, such as people, vehicles, and animals. Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing, and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections, correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally, some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick understanding of this field to the community."

TI,Platys: An Active Learning Framework for Place-Aware Application
,Development and Its Evaluation
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB,"We introduce a high-level abstraction of location called place. A place derives its meaning from a user's physical space, activities, or social context. In this manner, place can facilitate improved user experience compared to the traditional representation of location, which is spatial coordinates. We propose the Platys framework as a way to address the special challenges of place-aware application development. The core of Platys is a middleware that (1) learns a model of places specific to each user via active learning, a machine learning paradigm that seeks to reduce the user-effort required for training the middleware, and (2) exposes the learned user-specific model of places to applications at run time, insulating application developers from dealing with both low-level sensors and user idiosyncrasies in perceiving places."
,"We evaluated Platys via two studies. First, we collected place labels and Android phone sensor readings from 10 users. We applied Platys' active learning approach to learn each user's places and found that Platys (1) requires fewer place labels to learn a user's places with a desired accuracy than do two traditional supervised approaches, and (2) learns places with higher accuracy than two unsupervised approaches."
,"Second, we conducted a developer study to evaluate Platys' efficiency in assisting developers and its effectiveness in enabling usable applications. In this study, 46 developers employed either Platys or the Android location API to develop a place-aware application. Our results indicate that application developers employing Platys, when compared to those employing the Android API, (1) develop a place-aware application faster and perceive reduced difficulty and (2) produce applications that are easier to understand (for developers) and potentially more usable and privacy preserving (for application users)."

TI,Topic based context-aware travel recommendation method exploiting
,geotagged photos
SO,NEUROCOMPUTING
AB,"The popularity of camera phones and photo sharing websites, e.g. Flickr and Panoramio, has led to huge volumes of community-contributed geotagged photos (CCGPs) available on the Internet, which could be regarded as digital footprints of photo takers. In this paper, we propose a method to recommend travel locations in a city for a user, based on topic distribution of his travel histories in other cities and the given context (i.e., season and weather). A topic model is used to mine the interest distribution of users, which is then exploited to build the user-user similarity model and make travel recommendations. The season and weather context information is considered during the mining and the recommendation processes. Our method is evaluated on a Flickr dataset, which contains photos taken in 11 cities of China. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the precision of travel behavior prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

TI,CEPR: A Collaborative Exploration and Periodically Returning Model for
,Location Prediction
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"With the growing popularity of location-based social networks, numerous location visiting records (e.g., checkins) continue to accumulate over time. The more these records are collected, the better we can understand users' mobility patterns and the more accurately we can predict their future locations. However, due to the personality trait of neophilia, people also show propensities of novelty seeking in human mobility, that is, exploring unvisited but tailored locations for them to visit. As such, the existing prediction algorithms, mainly relying on regular mobility patterns, face severe challenges because such behavior is beyond the reach of regularity. As a matter of fact, the prediction of this behavior not only relies on the forecast of novelty-seeking tendency but also depends on how to determine unvisited candidate locations. To this end, we put forward a Collaborative Exploration and Periodically Returning model (CEPR), based on a novel problem, Exploration Prediction (EP), which forecasts whether people will seek unvisited locations to visit, in the following. When people are predicted to do exploration, a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm, armed with collaborative social knowledge and assisted by geographical influence, will be applied for seeking the suitable candidates; otherwise, a traditional prediction algorithm, incorporating both regularity and the Markov model, will be put into use for figuring out the most possible locations to visit. We then perform case studies on check-ins and evaluate them on two large-scale check-in datasets with 6M and 36M records, respectively. The evaluation results show that EP achieves a roughly 20% classification error rate on both datasets, greatly outperforming the baselines, and that CEPR improves performances by as much as 30% compared to the traditional location prediction algorithms."

TI,A Dilution-matching-encoding compaction of trajectories over road
,networks
SO,GEOINFORMATICA
AB,"Many devices nowadays record traveled routes as sequences of GPS locations. With the growing popularity of smartphones, millions of such routes are generated each day, and many routes have to be stored locally on the device or transmitted to a remote database. It is, thus, essential to encode the sequences, in order to decrease the volume of the stored or transmitted data. In this paper we study the problem of encoding routes over a vectorial road network (map), where GPS locations can be associated with vertices or with road segments. We consider a three-step process of dilution, map-matching and coding, which helps reducing the amount of transmitted data between the cellular device and remote servers. We present two methods to code routes. The first method represents the given route as a sequence of greedy paths. We provide two algorithms to generate a greedy-path code for a sequence of n vertices on the map. The first algorithm has O(n) time complexity, and the second one has O(n (2)) time complexity, but it is optimal, meaning that it generates the shortest possible greedy-path code. Decoding a greedy-path code can be done in O(n) time. The second method encodes a route as a sequence of shortest paths. We provide algorithms to generate unidirectional and bidirectional optimal shortest-path codes. Encoding and decoding a shortest-path code can be done in O(k n (2) logn) time, where k is the length of the produced code, assuming the graph valency is bounded. Our experimental evaluation shows that shortest-path codes are more compact than greedy-path codes, justifying the larger time complexity."

TI,Semantic-Based Location Recommendation With Multimodal Venue Semantics
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA
AB,"In recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of location-based social networks. A well-formed representation of location knowledge is desired to cater to the need of location sensing, browsing, navigation and querying. In this paper, we aim to study the semantics of point-of-interest (POI) by exploiting the abundant heterogeneous user generated content (UGC) from different social networks. Our idea is to explore the text descriptions, photos, user check-in patterns, and venue context for location semantic similarity measurement. We argue that the venue semantics play an important role in user check-in behavior. Based on this argument, a unified POI recommendation algorithm is proposed by incorporating venue semantics as a regularizer. In addition to deriving user preference based on user-venue check-in information, we place special emphasis on location semantic similarity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of location semantic similarity and location recommendation over a real world dataset collected from Foursquare and Instagram. Experimental results show that the UGC information can well characterize the venue semantics, which help to improve the recommendation performance."

AB,"Location recommendation plays an essential role in helping people find places they are likely to enjoy. Though some recent research has studied how to recommend locations with the presence of social network and geographical information, few of them addressed the cold-start problem, specifically, recommending locations for new users. Because the visits to locations are often shared on social networks, rich semantics (e.g., tweets) that reveal a person's interests can be leveraged to tackle this challenge. A typical way is to feed them into traditional explicit-feedback content-aware recommendation methods (e.g., LibFM). As a user's negative preferences are not explicitly observable in most human mobility data, these methods need draw negative samples for better learning performance. However, prior studies have empirically shown that sampling-based methods don't perform as well as a method that considers all unvisited locations as negative but assigns them a lower confidence. To this end, we propose an Implicit-feedback based Content-aware Collaborative Filtering (ICCF) framework to incorporate semantic content and steer clear of negative sampling. For efficient parameter learning, we develop a scalable optimization algorithm, scaling linearly with the data size and the feature size. Furthermore, we offer a good explanation to ICCF, such that the semantic content is actually used to refine user similarity based on mobility. Finally, we evaluate ICCF with a large-scale LBSN dataset where users have profiles and text content. The results show that ICCF outperforms LibFM of the best configuration, and that user profiles and text content are not only effective at improving recommendation but also helpful for coping with the cold-start problem."

With the ever increasing popularity and lowering costs of such personal devices such as Smart Phones, collecting data from the mobile sensors available in these devices becomes feasible. A wealth of information can be gleaned from such data collected from these sensors which reveals various aspects of the individual's behaviour and activity. Existing approaches for analyzing such data mainly focuses on inferring semantic context and detecting associations from such data. For example, GPS enabled devices allow users to record their movements in the form of spatio-temporal stream points, and meaningful information can be extracted based on different research objectives."

Moreover, we have proposed an approach to improve the performance of the semantic annotation process of this framework, by combining different sources of mobile sensor data (i.e. GPS and audio data). The proposed framework and approaches have been validated on actual data sets which include the Microsoft's Geolife data set and a data set collected by ourselves."

AB,"Link prediction for new users who have not created any link is a fundamental problem in Online Social Networks (OSNs). It can be used to recommend friends for new users to start building their social networks. The existing studies use cross platform approaches to predict a new user's links on a certain OSN by porting his existing links from other OSNs. However, it cannot work when OSNs are not willing to share their data or users do not want to connect different OSN accounts. In this paper, we use a single-platform approach to carry out the link prediction. We explore the users' profile attributes (e.g., workplace, high school and hometown) which can be easily obtained during the new users' sign up procedure. Based on the limited available information from the new user, along with the attributes and links from existing users, we extract three types of social features: basic feature, derived feature and latent relation feature. We propose a link prediction model using these social features based on Support Vector Machines. Eventually, we rely on a large Facebook data set consisting of 479,000 users to evaluate our proposed model. The result reveals that our model outperforms the baselines by achieving the MX value of 0.83; it also demonstrates that each of the proposed social features contribute significantly to the prediction model."

GPS logs are good source to extract information about user's preferences and interests. In this paper, we first aim to discover and learn individual user's preferences for various locations they have visited in the past by analyzing and mining the user's GPS logs. We have used the GPS trajectory dataset of 178 users collected by Microsoft Research Asia's GeoLife project collected in a period of over four years.

We have proposed a novel approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to model the interest of user for unvisited location. The two approaches have been implemented using Java and MATLAB and the results are compared for evaluation. The recommendation results of proposed approach are comparable with matrix factorization based approach and shows improvement of 4.1 % (approx.) on average root mean squared error (RMSE)."

,distance is not dead
SO,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C
AB,"Partly due to the difficulty of the access to a worldwide dataset that simultaneously captures the location history and social networks, our understanding of the relationship between human mobility and the social ties has been limited. However, this topic is essential for a deeper study from human dynamics and social networks aspects. In this paper, we examine the location history data and social networks data of 712 email users and 399 offline events users from a map-editing based social network website. Based on these data, we expand all our experiment both from individual aspect and community aspect. We find that the physical distance is still the most influential factor to social ties among the nine representative human mobility features extracted from our GPS trajectory dataset, although Internet revolution has made long-distance communication dramatically faster, easier and cheaper than ever before, and in turn, partly expand the physical scope of social networks. Furthermore, we find that to a certain extent, the proximity of South North direction is more influential than East West direction to social ties. To the our best of our knowledge, this difference between South North and East West is the first time to be raised and quantitatively supported by a large dataset. We believe our findings on the interplay of human mobility and social ties offer a new perspective to this field of study."

These data transactions attract many data mining researchers to infer various information from them. In this paper, a geographic business prediction technique is proposed, which infers business usage by exploiting data published about venues in Location Based Social Networks. The proposed technique is beneficial for investors and business decision makers. The proposed geo-business prediction technique considers spatial and categorical factors in the prediction process. Both factors affect the prediction accuracy rather than using traditional spatial prediction techniques, which are usually used where only the location feature is involved in the prediction process. Additionally, an outlier filter is proposed and applied to the data to avoid extreme values involvement in the prediction process in order to achieve better prediction accuracy. To test the proposed technique, an experimental case study is implemented. It uses data extracted from Foursquare about business venues in Texas State in the United States of America. The proposed geo business prediction technique has shown to provide better prediction accuracy than k nearest neighbor spatial prediction. The Application of the outlier filter, results in even higher prediction accuracy for the proposed technique."

,Location-Based Services
SO,SENSORS
AB,"The disruptive innovation of smartphone technology has enabled the development of mobile sensing applications leveraged on specialized sensors embedded in the device. These novel mobile phone applications rely on advanced sensor information processes, which mainly involve raw data acquisition, feature extraction, data interpretation and transmission. However, the continuous accessing of sensing resources to acquire sensor data in smartphones is still very expensive in terms of energy, particularly due to the periodic use of power-intensive sensors, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The key underlying idea to design energy-efficient schemes is to control the duty cycle of the GPS receiver. However, adapting the sensing rate based on dynamic context changes through a flexible middleware has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel modular middleware architecture and runtime environment to directly interface with application programming interfaces (APIs) and embedded sensors in order to manage the duty cycle process based on energy and context aspects. The proposed solution has been implemented in the Android software stack. It allows continuous location tracking in a timely manner and in a transparent way to the user. It also enables the deployment of sensing policies to appropriately control the sampling rate based on both energy and perceived context. We validate the proposed solution taking into account a reference location-based service (LBS) architecture. A cloud-based storage service along with online mobility analysis tools have been used to store and access sensed data. Experimental measurements demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our middleware, in terms of energy and location resolution."

A main challenge in such systems is on the creation of stable links between users. For each online user, the current SoLoMo system continuously returns his/her kNN (k Nearest Neighbor) users based on their geo-locations. Such a recommendation approach is simple, but fails to create sustainable friendships. Instead, it would be more effective to tap onto the existing social relationships in conventional social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, to provide a ""better"" friend recommendations."
,"To measure the similarity between users, we propose a new metric, co-space distance, by considering both the user distances in the real world (physical distance) and the virtual world (social distance). The co-space distance measures the similarity of two users in the SoLoMo system. We compute the social distances between users based on their public information in the conventional social networks, which can be achieved by a few MapReduce jobs. To facilitate efficient computation of the social distance, we build a distributed index on top of the key-value store, and maintain the users' geo-locations using an R-tree. For each query on finding potential friends around a location, we return kNN neighbors to each user based on their co-space distances. We propose a progressive top-k processing strategy and an adaptive-caching strategy to facilitate efficient query processing. Experiments with Gowalla dataset(1) show the effectiveness and efficiency of our recommendation approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

TI,Exploring Sequential Probability Tree for Movement-Based Community
,Discovery
SO,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB,"In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering movement-based communities of users, where users in the same community have similar movement behaviors. Note that the identification of movement-based communities is beneficial to location-based services and trajectory recommendation services. Specifically, we propose a framework to mine movement-based communities which consists of three phases: 1) constructing trajectory profiles of users, 2) deriving similarity between trajectory profiles, and 3) discovering movement-based communities. In the first phase, we design a data structure, called the Sequential Probability tree (SP-tree), as a user trajectory profile. SP-trees not only derive sequential patterns, but also indicate transition probabilities of movements. Moreover, we propose two algorithms: BF (standing for breadth-first) and DF (standing for depth-first) to construct SP-tree structures as user profiles. To measure the similarity values among users' trajectory profiles, we further develop a similarity function that takes SP-tree information into account. In light of the similarity values derived, we formulate an objective function to evaluate the quality of communities. According to the objective function derived, we propose a greedy algorithm Geo-Cluster to effectively derive communities. To evaluate our proposed algorithms, we have conducted comprehensive experiments on two real data sets. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can effectively discover movement-based user communities."

TI,Constructing and Comparing User Mobility Profiles
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB
AB,"Nowadays, the accumulation of people's whereabouts due to location-based applications has made it possible to construct their mobility profiles. This access to users' mobility profiles subsequently brings benefits back to location-based applications. For instance, in on-line social networks, friends can be recommended not only based on the similarity between their registered information, for instance, hobbies and professions but also referring to the similarity between their mobility profiles."
,"In this article, we propose a new approach to construct and compare users' mobility profiles. First, we improve and apply frequent sequential pattern mining technologies to extract the sequences of places that a user frequently visits and use them to model his mobility profile. Second, we present a new method to calculate the similarity between two users using their mobility profiles. More specifically, we identify the weaknesses of a similarity metric in the literature, and propose a new one which not only fixes the weaknesses but also provides more precise and effective similarity estimation. Third, we consider the semantics of spatio-temporal information contained in user mobility profiles and add them into the calculation of user similarity. It enables us to measure users' similarity from different perspectives. Two specific types of semantics are explored in this article: location semantics and temporal semantics. Last, we validate our approach by applying it to two real-life datasets collected by Microsoft Research Asia and Yonsei University, respectively. The results show that our approach outperforms the existing works from several aspects."

,phones. GPS trajectory data is useful for applications such as traffic
,"management, location forecasting, and itinerary planning. Such"
,applications often need to extract the time-stamped sequence of visited
,locations (SVLs) of the mobile objects. The nearest neighbor query (NNQ)
,is the most applied method for labeling the visited locations based on
,the IDs of the points of interests (POIs) in the process of SVL
,generation. NNQ in some scenarios is not accurate enough. To improve the

,annotation content in using each approach in the field. Our results
,suggested that although Context-Triggered approaches produced a larger
,"number of recordings, they did not necessarily lead to a larger quantity"
,of data than the Participatory approach. It was because many of the

,having the control over what and when to record and annotate that the
,"Participatory approach provided. Finally, we showed that activity type"
,"(Driver, Riding as Passenger, Walking) influenced users' behaviors in"
,recording and annotating their activity data. It influenced the timing

AB,With the increasing use of mobile GPS (global positioning system)
,"devices, a large volume of trajectory data on users can be produced. In"
,"most existing work, trajectories are usually divided into a set of stops"
,"and moves. In trajectories, stops represent the most important and"
,meaningful part of the trajectory; there are many data mining methods to
,extract these locations. DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
,applications with noise) is a classical density-based algorithm used to
,"find the high-density areas in space, and different derivative methods"
,of this algorithm have been proposed to find the stops in trajectories.
,"However, most of these methods required a manually-set threshold, such"
,"as the speed threshold, for each feature variable. In our research, we"
,"first defined our new concept of move ability. Second, by introducing"
,the theory of data fields and by taking our new concept of move ability
,"into consideration, we constructed a new, comprehensive, hybrid"
,"feature-based, density measurement method which considers temporal and"
,"spatial properties. Finally, an improved DBSCAN algorithm was proposed"
,"using our new density measurement method. In the Experimental Section,"
,the effectiveness and efficiency of our method is validated against real
,datasets. When comparing our algorithm with the classical density-based
,"clustering algorithms, our experimental results show the efficiency of"
,the proposed method.

AB,The potential of geospatial big data has been drawing attention for a
,few years. Despite the larger and larger market penetration of portable
,technologies (nomadic and wearable devices like smartphones and
,"smartwatches), their opportunities for travel behavior analysis are"
,still relatively unexplored. The main objective of our study is to
,extract the human mobility patterns from GPS traces in order to derive
,an indicator for enhancing Collaborative Mobility (CM) between
,"individuals. The first step, extracting activity duration and location,"
,is done using state-of-the-art automated recognition tools. Sensors data
,are used to reconstruct individual's activity location and duration
,"across time. For constructing the indicator, in a second step, we"
,defined different variables and methods for specific case studies.
,Smartphone sensor data are being collected from a limited number of
,individuals and for one week. These data are used to evaluate the
,"proposed indicator. Based on the value of the indicator, we analyzed the"
,"potential for identifying CM among groups of users, such as sharing"
,"traveling resources (e.g., carpooling, ridesharing, parking sharing) and"
,time (rescheduling and reordering activities).

AB,"As mobile crowd sensing (MCS) cannot provide reliable services, the"
,quality of service (QoS) is a major research interest. Since the service
,"node makes a decisive impact on two vital factors of QoS, service node"
,"selection is becoming a novel research direction in MCS. In this paper,"
,we analyze the factors that need attention when selecting proper service
,nodes in MCS and define the service node selection problem (SNSP) as
,"follows: finding the optimal set of service nodes, provided that"
,optimizes multiple metrics of QoS simultaneously and satisfies the
,"network resource constraint. Accordingly, we formulate a multiobjective"
,"optimization model (MOOM), which converts SNSP to a multiobjective"
,optimization problem (MOOP). Since the MOOM considers the comprehensive
,"effect of all service nodes on one metric as one objective of MOOP, it"
,can handle the diversity of metrics and conflicts between them; in
,"particular, it can flexibly change the metric system of QoS depending on"
,different demands. To demonstrate the value and effectiveness of the
,"proposed MOOM, we propose a paradigm of it and design a corresponding"
,multiobjective optimization selection mechanism. This paradigm focuses
,on the influence of node spatiotemporal mobility on both data collection
,and data transmission. Extensive experiments and comparison on a
,real-world data show that MOOM is an effective model for selecting
,service nodes with both good coverage and transmission performances.

,check-in their places or use geo-tagging which implicitly reveals
,"locations. This ""geo tracking"" can help to find topics triggered by"
,"certain events in certain regions. However, discovering such topics is"
,very challenging because of the large amount of noisy messages (e.g.
,daily conversations). This paper proposes a method to model geographical
,"topics, which can filter out irrelevant words by different weights in"
,the local and global contexts. Our method is based on the Latent
,Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model but each word is generated from either
,a local or a global topic distribution by its generation probabilities.
,"We evaluated our model with data collected from Weibo, which is"
,currently the most popular micro-blogging service for Chinese. The
,evaluation results demonstrate that our method outperforms other
,"baseline methods in several metrics such as model perplexity, two kinds"
,of entropies and KL-divergence of discovered topics.

AB,Human mobility modelling has emerged as an important research area over
,the past years. The opportunities that mobility modelling offers are
,widespread. From smart transportation services to reliable
,"recommendations systems, all require generation of mobility models."
,Since mobility of humans is generally motivated by the activities they
,"perform, activity recognition emerges as a vital initial step towards"
,building better and accurate mobility models. The activity recognition
,"can be carried out by analyzing relevant data from GPS devices,"
,accelerometers and many other sensing sources. The most common approach
,"is to combine data from different sources, analyze that data and"
,"recognize the type of activity being performed. However, this requires"
,access to many specialized devices and customized infrastructures. As an
,"alternate, this paper introduces a novel approach to recognize"
,activities from the GPS traces only. This approach utilizes
,Adaptive-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which combines the power
,of neural networks and fuzzy logic to recognize activities. The approach
,is tested on three different datasets and shows promising results. In
,"addition to this a multi-cloud architecture is proposed, for the"
,deployment of such a system.

AB,"With the development of mobile communication technology, mobile phones"
,play a more important role in people's daily life. The user's location
,"and its semantic are very important to Location Based Services (LBS),"
,and this inspires a tremendous amount of research effort on analyzing
,large-scale trajectory data to mine these informations in the last
,"decade. The existing researches have achieved good results, but there"
,"are still some challenges, such as the limitation on low quality data."
,"In this paper, firstly, we propose a novel algorithm to mine meaningful"
,"points on cellular network data, which can reduce the processing time"
,"apparently by conditional filtering original data. Then, we adopt a"
,density based clustering method together with a naive Bayes classifier
,to complete the important location discovery and semantic analysis.
,Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real dataset show
,that: 1) The precision rate and recall rate of identifying important
,"locations have reached more than 96%, which are improved by nearly 3%"
,"comparing with the existing algorithms. Meanwhile, the precision rate"
,and recall rate of semantic analysis are also increased by more than 4%.
,"2) When applying to low quality data, the proposed approach is also"
,"robust, efficient and has a good performance."

TI,A Hybrid Model Towards Moving Route Prediction Under Data Sparsity

PD,2017
PY,2017
AB,Moving route prediction offers important benefits for many emerging
,location-aware applications such as target advertising and urban traffic
,management. A common approach to route prediction is to match similar
,"trace recordings from a larger volume of historical trajectories, and"
,"return the targeted recorded path as desired answer. However, due to"
,"privacy concerns, incentive mechanism and other reasons, especially in"
,"small business environment, a limited dataset with sparse trajectories"
,"is only available. Actually, the existing sparse dataset cannot cover"
,"sufficient query routes, and then the match-based approach may return no"
,"results at all. Moreover, the existing sparse dataset may fail many"
,trajectory mining approaches that work well on general environment. In
,"this paper, we investigate moving route prediction from sparse"
,"trajectory dataset, and propose a novel hybrid model, namely HMRP, to"
,address the above problem. To avoid sparse distribution over spatial
,"semantic layer, a road network map reconstruction methods are proposed"
,to accommodate the sparse trajectories in semantic transformation. And
,"then, by training historical trajectories, the implicit mobility"
,patterns and Markov transition model are constructed to support route
,"prediction. When a query trajectory arrives, towards its derived"
,"potential destination, our proposed HMRP model integrates pattern"
,matching strategy and Markov probability distribution to predict its
,future route gradually in a complementary way. Experiments on real-life
,taxicab GPS recorded dataset demonstrate that HMRP method can improve
,"movement prediction precision significantly, comparing with the baseline"
,prediction algorithms. And the response time for each query trajectory
,is acceptable for most application cases.

,This processing is intended to detect the mode of transport of a user in

,These data are plotted from decimal coordinates to cartesian
,coordinates. The second presents the classification for the detection of
,transport modes with cartesian coordinates. It also contains the
,analysis of states of kinematic movements. The tests are performed
,through a dataset taken from the GeoLife project of Microsoft Asia. The

AB,Social media applications are widely deployed in mobile platforms
,"equipped with built-in GPS tracking devices, and these devices have led"
,"to an unprecedented collection of geolocated data (geo-tags). Geo-tags,"
,"along with place names, offer new opportunities to explore the"
,"trajectory and mobility patterns of social media users. However,"
,trajectory data captured by social media are sparsely and irregularly
,spaced and therefore have varying degrees of resolution in both space
,and time. Previous studies on next location prediction are mostly
,applicable for detecting the upcoming location of a moving object using
,dense GPS trajectories where locations are recorded at regular time
,"intervals (e.g., 1 minute). Additionally, point features are commonly"
,"used to represent the locations of visits, but using point features"
,cannot capture the variability of human mobility. This article
,introduces a new methodology to predict an individual's next location
,based on sparse footprints accumulated over a long time period using
,"social networks, and uses polygons to represent the location"
,"corresponding to the physical activity area of individuals. First, the"
,density-based spatial clustering algorithm is employed to discover the
,most representative activity zones that an individual frequently visits
,"on a daily basis, and a polygon-based region is then derived for each"
,representative activity zone. A sparse mobility Markov chain model
,considering both the movements and online behaviors of the social media
,user is trained and used to predict the user's next location. Initial
,experiments with a group of Washington DC Twitter users demonstrate that
,the proposed methodology successfully discovers the activity regions and
,predicts the user's next location with accuracy approaching 78.94%.

AB,The availability of massive digital traces of individuals is offering a
,series of novel insights on the understanding of patterns characterizing
,human mobility. Many studies try to semantically enrich mobility data
,"with annotations about human activities. However, these approaches"
,"either focus on places with high frequencies (e.g., home and work), or"
,"relay on background knowledge (e.g., public available points of"
,"interest). In this paper, we depart from the concept of frequency and we"
,focus on a high level representation of mobility using network
,analytics. The visits of each driver to each systematic destination are
,modeled as links in a bipartite network where a set of nodes represents
,drivers and the other set represents places. We extract such network
,"from two real datasets of human mobility based, respectively, on GPS and"
,GSM data. We introduce the concept of mobility complexity of drivers and
,places as a ranking analysis over the nodes of these networks. In
,"addition, by means of community discovery analysis, we differentiate"

AB,Understanding human activity patterns plays a key role in various
,"applications in an urban environment, such as transportation planning"
,"and traffic forecasting, urban planning, public health and safety, and"
,emergency response. Most existing studies in modeling human activity
,"patterns mainly focus on spatio-temporal dimensions, which lacks"
,"consideration of underlying semantic context. In fact, what people do"
,"and discuss at some places, inferring what is happening at the places,"
,cannot be simple neglected because it is the root of human mobility
,"patterns. We believe that the geo-tagged semantic context, representing"
,"what individuals do and discuss at a place and a specific time, drives a"
,"formation of specific human activity pattern. In this paper, we aim to"
,model human activity patterns not only based on space and time but also
,"with consideration of associated semantics, and attempt to prove a"
,hypothesis that similar mobility patterns may have different
,motivations. We develop a spatiotemporal-semantic model to
,"quantitatively express human activity patterns based on topic models,"
,"leading to an analysis of space, time and semantics. A case study is"
,conducted using Twitter data in Toronto based on our model. Through
,computing the similarities between users in terms of spatiotemporal
,"pattern, semantic pattern and spatiotemporal-semantic pattern, we find"
,that only a small number of users (2.72%) have very similar activity
,"patterns, while the majority (87.14%) show different activity patterns"
,"(i.e., similar spatiotemporal patterns and different semantic patterns,"
,"similar semantic patterns and different spatiotemporal patterns, or"
,different in both). The population of users that has very similar
,activity patterns is decreased by 56.41% after incorporating semantic
,"information in the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns, which can"
,quantitatively prove the hypothesis. (C) 2016 International Society for

AB,Understanding travel behavior is critical for an effective urban
,planning as well as for enabling various context-aware service
,provisions to support mobility as a service (MaaS). Both applications
,rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers' smartphones. These
,"traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating"
,automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection.
,"Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop"
,"in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing"
,approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and
,"uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also,"
,segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of
,"open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the"

,based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed
,"atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based"
,"segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The"
,research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be
,"developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and"
,offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their
,varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed

AB,Destination prediction is very important in location-based services such
,as recommendation of targeted advertising location. Most current
,approaches always predict destination according to existing trip based
,"on history trajectories. However, no existing work has considered the"
,difference between the effects of passing-by locations and the
,"destination in history trajectories, which seriously impacts the"
,accuracy of predicted results as the destination can indicate the
,"purpose of traveling. Meanwhile, the temporal information of history"
,trajectories in destination prediction plays an important role. On one
,"hand, the history trajectories in different periods also differ in the"
,"influence, e.g., the history trajectories from last week can reflect the"
,status quo more accurately than the history trajectories two years ago.
,"On the other hand, the history trajectories in different time slots"
,"reflect different facts of traffic and moving habits of people, e.g.,"
,visiting a restaurant in the daytime and visiting a bar at night.
,Although a huge amount of history trajectories can be achieved in the
,"era of big data, it is still far from covering all the query"
,trajectories since a road network is widely distributed and trajectory
,data is sparse. The temporal sensitivity of history trajectories
,"highlights the sparsity problem even more. Therefore, we propose a novel"
,model T-DesP to solve the aforementioned problems. The model is
,comprised of two modules: trajectory learning and destination
,"prediction. In the module of trajectory learning, a novel method called"
,the mirror absorbing Markov chain model is proposed for modeling the
,trajectories for isolating the destination. We build a transition tensor
,to deduce the transition probability between each location pair in a
,"particular time slot. To address the data sparsity problem, we fill the"
,missing values in transition tensor through a context-aware tensor
,"decomposition approach. In the module of destination prediction, an"
,"absorbing tensor is derived from the filled transition tensor, and the"
,theoretical model is established for destination prediction. The
,experiments prove the effectiveness and efficiency of T-DesP.

AB,The current age of increased people mobility calls for a better
,understanding of how people move: how many places does an individual
,"commonly visit, what are the semantics of these places, and how do"
,people get from one place to another. We show that the number of places
,visited by each person (Points of Interest - PoIs) is regulated by some
,properties that are statistically similar among individuals.
,"Subsequently, we present a Pals classification in terms of their"
,"relevance on a per-user basis. In addition to the Pols relevance, we"
,also investigate the variables that describe the travel rules among PoIs
,"in particular, the spatial and temporal distance. As regards the latter,"
,existing works on mobility are mainly based on spatial distance. Here we
,"argue, rather, that for human mobility the temporal distance and the"
,"Pols relevance are the major driving factors. Moreover, we study the"
,semantic of Pols. This is useful for deriving statistics on people's
,habits without breaking their privacy. With the support of different
,"datasets, our paper provides an in-depth analysis of Pols distribution"
,and semantics; it also shows that our results hold independently of the
,nature of the dataset in use. We illustrate that our approach is able to

AB,Most of the existing algorithms cannot effectively solve the data sparse
,problem of trajectory prediction. This paper proposes a novel sparse
,"trajectory prediction method based on L-Z entropy estimation. Firstly,"
,the moving region of trajectories is divided into a two-dimensional
,"plane grid graph, and then the original trajectories are mapped to the"
,grid graph so that each trajectory can be represented as a grid
,"sequence. Secondly, an L-Z entropy estimator is used to calculate the"
,"entropy value of each grid sequence, and then the trajectory which has a"
,comparatively low entropy value is segmented into several
,sub-trajectories. The new trajectory space is synthesised by these
,sub-trajectories based on trajectory entropy. The trajectory synthesis
,"can not only resolve the sparse problem of trajectory data, but also"
,"make the new trajectory space more credible. In addition, the trajectory"
,"scale is limited in a certain range. Finally, under the new trajectory"
,"space, Markov model and Bayesian Inference is applied to trajectory"
,prediction with data sparsity. The experiments based on the taxi
,trajectory dataset of Microsoft Research Asia show the proposed method
,can make an effective prediction for the sparse trajectory. Compared
,"with the existing methods, our method needs a smaller trajectory space"
,"and provides much wider predicting range, faster predicting speed and"
,better predicting accuracy.

AB,Human mobility is important for understanding the evolution of size and
,"structure of urban areas, the spatial distribution of facilities, and"
,"the provision of transportation services. Until recently, exploring"
,human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods
,"consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or"
,interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly
,altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human
,movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in
,"identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate"
,solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental
,context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt
,to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of
,human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and
,contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the
,identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places)
,"behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and"
,spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how
,"travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the"
,"tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which"
,are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend
,time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We
,evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205
,volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of
,places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this
,study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new
,possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.

,services by inferring Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs) and recommending
,popular travel routes from trip trajectories. We argue that simply
,providing some travel routes consisting of popular ROIs to users is not
,"sufficient. To tour around a wide geographical area, for example, a"
,"city, some users may prefer a trip to visit as many ROIs as possible,"
,while others may like to stop by only a few ROIs for an in-depth visit.
,We refer to a trip fitting the former user group as an in-breadth trip
,and a trip suitable for the latter user group as an in-depth trip. Prior
,studies on trip planning have focused on mining ROIs and travel routes
,"without considering these different preferences. In this article, given"
,a spatial range and a user preference of depth/breadth specified by a
,"user, we develop a Pattern-Aware Trajectory Search (PATS) framework to"
,retrieve the top K trajectories passing through popular ROIs. PATS is
,"novel because the returned travel trajectories, discovered from travel"
,"patterns hidden in trip trajectories, may represent the most valuable"
,travel experiences of other travelers fitting the user's trip preference
,in terms of depth or breadth. The PATS framework comprises two
,components: travel behavior exploration and trajectory search. The
,travel behavior exploration component determines a set of ROIs along
,with their attractive scores by considering not only the popularity of
,the ROIs but also the travel sequential relationships among the ROIs. To
,capture the travel sequential relationships among ROIs and to derive
,"their attractive scores, a user movement graph is constructed. For the"
,"trajectory search component of PATS, we formulate two trajectory score"
,"functions, the depth-trip score function and the breadth-trip score"
,"function, by taking into account the number of ROIs in a trajectory and"
,"their attractive scores. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm, namely,"
,"Bounded Trajectory Search (BTS), to efficiently retrieve the top K"
,trajectories based on the two trajectory scores. The PATS framework is
,evaluated by experiments and user studies using a real dataset. The
,experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of
,the proposed PATS framework.

,"GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with"
,"spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some"

,"understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article,"
,we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and
,location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on
,"the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's"
,visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their
,"implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity"
,between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each
,"user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate"
,an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving
,his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited
,locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the
,"individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based"
,"similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each"
,"individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity"
,"among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1)"
,"the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited"
,"popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of"
,"geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into"

,"user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We"
,evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75
,"subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM"
,"outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count,"
,"cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the"

AB,Trajectories have been providing us with a wealth of derived information
,such as traffic conditions and road network updates. This work focuses
,on deriving user profiles through spatiotemporal analysis of trajectory
,data to provide insight into the quality of information provided by
,users. The presented behavior profiling method assesses user
,participation characteristics in a treasure-hunt type event. Consisting
,"of an analysis and a profiling phase, analysis involves a timeline and a"
,"stay-point analysis, as well as a semantic trajectory inspection"
,relating actual and expected paths. The analysis results are then
,grouped around profiles that can be used to estimate the user
,performance in the activity. The proposed profiling method is evaluated
,by means of a student orientation treasure-hunt activity at the
,"University of Twente, The Netherlands. The profiling method is used to"
,predict the students' gaming behavior by means of a simple team type
,"classification, and a feature-based answer type classification."

AB,Movement data sets collected using today's advanced tracking devices
,"consist of complex trajectories in terms of length, shape, and number of"

,movement and its environment are often also included making the level of
,complexity even higher. Simplification of trajectories can improve the

,trajectories in order to support their visual analysis. The methodology
,is applied iteratively and is composed of: (a) a simplification step
,"applied to reduce the morphological complexity of the trajectories, (b)"

,are also proposed to optimize spatio-temporal R-tree structures. In
,"addition, a B*-tree sub-index of leaf nodes is built to query the"

,framework. Existing transfer detection algorithms are based on a
,walking-based approach. But in a walking-based approach it is difficult
,to set a deterministic walking threshold. However during transfer people
,generally move slowly or wait for a while and thus the spatio-temporal
,points are located close to each other and tend to form clusters. To
,mitigate such problems an adaptive density-based fuzzy approach is
,proposed for detecting transfers and activities performed during
,transfers.

,"behavior, we present an approach to enrich trajectory data with semantic"
,POI information and show how additional insights can be gained. Using a
,density-based clustering technique we extract 1.215 frequent
,destinations of similar to 150.000 user movements from a large
,e-mobility database. We query available context information from
,"Foursquare, a popular location-based social network, to enrich the"

,often more then one possible destination is found and movement patterns
,vary over time. Therefore we present highly interactive visualizations

AB,The main search engines nowadays are able to quickly perform searches on
,"texts, images, audio or video. Recently a growing interest was devoted"
,to the searching in the field of a new type of data resulting from the
,"storage of GPS tracks: the trajectories. Therefore, we need to consider"
,new searching strategies and methods fit to these data structures. The
,idea is to design a search engine aimed at the indexing and retrieving
,trajectories in specific repositories. This paper describes a starting
,framework for semantic analysis of trajectories data. This framework
,aims at detecting and extracting features from GPS raw data. These
,"elements, in turn, populate new feature vectors in a MIRS Multimedia"
,"Browsing Indexing and Retrieval System, to support location-based"
,"queries. For several reasons, the feature extraction process starting"
,from raw GPS data is a multiple steps process. The raw GPS data are
,affected by noise and inaccuracies; the trajectories are not uniform and
,"homogeneous data because, for example, they are drawn by repeatedly"
,"changing the means of locomotion. Furthermore, the usual sections of"
,"trajectory ('trip segments'), describing a motion with certain kinematic"
,"parameters, could be alternated with slowly strolling around in confined"
,"areas ('activity') such as a mall, a gym or a small market. The reasons"
,listed above require the pre-processing of the raw GPS data in order to
,split the paths into uniform and homogeneous subsets. The pre-processing
,step removes the noise from the trajectories and separates the 'trip
,"segments' from the 'activities'. Next, each 'trip segment' is classified"
,using a sequence of two detection techniques based on fuzzy logic and
,"SVM. Finally, the synthetized trajectory components are stored in"
,"feature vectors, ready to start location-based queries for retrieval"
,"systems. The indexed trajectories will allow the queries in a database,"
,"for example, on both on-road routes and off-road trails. The model"
,proposed in this framework provides the basis module for support
,retrieving of pre-compiled trajectories but instead not supports the
,streaming of trajectories if the trajectory is not yet fully completed.

,could provide an important support for the decision makers in the fields
,"such as the investigation of criminal cases, group emergency disposal, a"
,large- scale military action etc. Following the pattern analysis of
,"mobile objects based on their position information, this paper proposes"
,a group member search method for mobile objects based on pattern
,"similarity, which identifies group members by utilizing the correlation"
,"information of the mobility attributes such as trajectory, speed,"
,direction and acceleration. Compared with group clustering or
,"classification based on trajectory distance, the overlapping"
,interference can be effectively avoided between members in different
,"groups, and this method fits the objective law of group movement better."
,"Combining with the application background, the experimental analysis"
,confirms that the proposed method can quickly and accurately find the

TI,Semantic trajectory-based high utility item recommendation system
SO,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB,"The topic on recommendation systems for mobile users has attracted a lot of attentions in recent years. However, most of the existing recommendation techniques were developed based only on geographic features of mobile users' trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recommending items for mobile users based on both the geographic and semantic features of users' trajectories. The core idea of our recommendation system is based on a novel cluster-based location prediction strategy, namely TrajUtiRec, to improve items recommendation model. Our proposed cluster-based location prediction strategy evaluates the next location of a mobile user based on the frequent behaviors of similar users in the same cluster determined by analyzing users' common behaviors in semantic trajectories. For each location, high utility itemset mining algorithm is performed for discovering high utility itemset. Accordingly, we can recommend the high utility itemset which is related to the location the user might visit. Through a comprehensive evaluation by experiments, our proposal is shown to deliver excellent performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

TI,Object-Oriented Travel Package Recommendation
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"Providing better travel services for tourists is one of the important applications in urban computing. Though many recommender systems have been developed for enhancing the quality of travel service, most of them lack a systematic and open framework to dynamically incorporate multiple types of additional context information existing in the tourism domain, such as the travel area, season, and price of travel packages. To that end, in this article, we propose an open framework, the Objected-Oriented Recommender System (ORS), for the developers performing personalized travel package recommendations to tourists. This framework has the ability to import all the available additional context information to the travel package recommendation process in a cost-effective way. Specifically, the different types of additional information are extracted and uniformly represented as feature-value pairs. Then, we define the Object, which is the collection of the feature-value pairs. We propose two models that can be used in the ORS framework for extracting the implicit relationships among Objects. The Objected-Oriented Topic Model (OTM) can extract the topics conditioned on the intrinsic feature-value pairs of the Objects. The Objected-Oriented Bayesian Network (OBN) can effectively infer the cotravel probability of two tourists by calculating the co-occurrence time of feature-value pairs belonging to different kinds of Objects. Based on the relationships mined by OTM or OBN, the recommendation list is generated by the collaborative filtering method. Finally, we evaluate these two models and the ORS framework on real-world travel package data, and the experimental results show that the ORS framework is more flexible in terms of incorporating additional context information, and thus leads to better performances for travel package recommendations. Meanwhile, for feature selection in ORS, we define the feature information entropy, and the experimental results demonstrate that using features with lower entropies usually leads to better recommendation results."

TI,Mining Check-In History for Personalized Location Naming
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of 5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names for 23.6% and 26.6% of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai, respectively."

TI,Recommending Friends Instantly in Location-based Mobile Social Networks
SO,CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB,"Differently from the general online social network (OSN), location-based mobile social network (LMSN), which seamlessly integrates mobile computing and social computing technologies, has unique characteristics of temporal, spatial and social correlation. Recommending friends instantly based on current location of users in the real world has become increasingly popular in LMSN. However, the existing friend recommendation methods based on topological structures of a social network or non-topological information such as similar user profiles cannot well address the instant making friends in the real world. In this article, we analyze users' check-in behavior in a real LMSN site named Gowalla. According to this analysis, we present an approach of recommending friends instantly for LMSN users by considering the real-time physical location proximity, offline behavior similarity and friendship network information in the virtual community simultaneously. This approach effectively bridges the gap between the offline behavior of users in the real world and online friendship network information in the virtual community. Finally, we use the real user check-in dataset of Gowalla to verify the effectiveness of our approach."

TI,Inferring social ties between users with human location history
SO,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
AB,"The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations. Different from previous work using social structures or directly matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm. The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109 users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several widely used sequence matching approaches given this application scenario."

AB,"Location-tagged social media have an increasingly important role in shaping behavior of individuals. With the help of location recommendations, users are able to learn about events, products or places of interest that are relevant to their preferences. User locations and movement patterns are available from geosocial networks such as Foursquare, mass transit logs or traffic monitoring systems. However, disclosing movement data raises serious privacy concerns, as the history of visited locations can reveal sensitive details about an individual's health status, alternative lifestyle, etc. In this paper, we investigate mechanisms to sanitize location data used in recommendations with the help of differential privacy. We also identify the main factors that must be taken into account to improve accuracy. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that a careful choice of differential privacy technique leads to satisfactory location recommendation results."

Travel smart cards, which record users' public transporting histories, capture rich information of users' mobility pattern. This provides the opportunity to discover valuable knowledge from these transaction records. In recent years, research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lot of attention in applications such as recommendation systems, crowd behavior analysis applications, and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper, our goal is to estimate the similarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data. The core of our proposal is a novel user similarity measurement, namely, Travel Spatial-Temporal Similarity (TST), which measures the spatial range and temporal similarity between users. Moreover, we also propose a hybrid index structure, which integrates inverted files and cluster-based partitioning, to allow for efficient retrieval of the top-K most similar users. Through experimental evaluation, our proposed approach is shown to deliver scalable performance."

However, as most of these prediction techniques need geographic pattern matching of users' trajectory data, it is possible that the techniques cannot work in a place where the user has never been before. In this paper, we propose an approach based on transportation mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location of the users' movement. First, we identify the users' transportation mode to get sequential data of the users' motion mode. Then, we get the semantic meaning as behavior semantic features from the places where users have stopped and visited for a while. We determine the relationship between the transportation mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location based on the Hidden Markov model. We use real world data for our experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

As it is known to all, a user's behavior often happened at some places where the user stayed over a certain time interval for a trip. For understanding a user's behavior effectively, we need to detect the places where the user stayed over a certain time interval and we call these places stay areas.

SO,MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB,"As there is great differences of movement patterns and social correlation between weekdays and weekends, we propose a fallback social-temporal-hierarchic Markov model (FSTHM) to predict individual's future location. The division of weekdays and weekends is used to decompose the original state of traditional Markov model into two different states and distinguish the difference of the strength of social ties on weekdays and weekends. Except for the time division, the distribution of the visit time for each state is also considered to improve the predictive performance. In addition, in order to best suit the characteristics of Markov model, we introduce the modified cross-sample entropy to quantify the similarities between the individual and his friends. The experiments based on real location-based social network show the FSTHM model gives a 9% improvement over the Markov model and 2% improvement over the social Markov models which use cosine similarity or mutual information to measure the social correlation."

TI,Practical Context Awareness Information System for Wireless Vehicular
,Networks Based on a Core Telematics Platform
SO,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB,"The popularization of consumer electronic products and the promotion of digital mobile devices have assisted telematics services in becoming more important and practicable. The global positioning system(GPS) is commonly used today and context awareness technologies are often adopted. To support efficient and effective telecommunications between a huge number of devices and the intelligent transport systems (ITS) services, a scalable networking platform is hence demanded. In this study, we present a novel approach to support an open architecture environment for telematics services based on international standards. The proposed core telematics platform (CTP) can optimize the data transmission under linearly increased time complexity by employing a high-scalable architecture design when a large number of devices connect to the application servers. The proposed context awareness application server (CAAS) approach can optimize context awareness features to provide personal tracking services to children and elders for safety purposes. The simulations and experiments in this study have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

AB,"Today, people have the opportunity to opt-in to usage-based automotive insurances for reduced premiums by allowing companies to monitor their driving behavior. Several companies claim to measure only speed data to preserve privacy. With our elastic pathing algorithm, we show that drivers can be tracked by merely collecting their speed data and knowing their home location, which insurance companies do, with an accuracy that constitutes privacy intrusion. To demonstrate the algorithm's real-world applicability, we evaluated its performance with datasets from central New Jersey and Seattle, Washington, representing suburban and urban areas. Our algorithm predicted destinations with error within 250 meters for 14% traces and within 500 meters for 24% traces in the New Jersey dataset (254 traces). For the Seattle dataset (691 traces), we similarly predicted destinations with error within 250 and 500 meters for 13% and 26% of the traces respectively. Our work shows that these insurance schemes enable a substantial breach of privacy."

SO,PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS
AB,"Mobile network user group of location-based service is of great value for O2O marketing. As a result check-in, as one of the most important parts of Location-Based Social Networks, has been attached with great attention. Through reflecting users' real offline life mode, it can explore the law behind the check-in behavior, which will help merchants better realize marketing precision and consumers get more high quality services at the same time. This paper collected check-in data in 6 months from one of China's largest social networks by using a crawler. It also designed a useful and effective Max Matching Algorithm, which creatively recognized check-in records so as to match these locations with POIs in POI Semantic Hierarchy Model, since users name the locations by themselves at will. Finally, a Check-in Behavior Information Model for each user could be constructed. On this basis, the paper analyzed users' empirical check-in data making using relevant statistics technology, such as descriptive statistics and cluster analysis, and studied the individual's main geographical activity areas and check-in POI types, Chinese users' regularity of check-in time distribution, all user's Significant Scores, and the dependent relationship between User Experience and POI Interest, in order to reveal the underlying user life mode and find out the frequency of check-in behavior. This paper hopes to find out active users and hot merchants to realize merchants ranking recommendation and loyal and potential consumers searching, and help local merchants improve the precision of marketing and provide better services for customs."

TI,Mining Geographic-Temporal-Semantic Patterns in Trajectories for
,Location Prediction
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"In recent years, research on location predictions by mining trajectories of users has attracted a lot of attention. Existing studies on this topic mostly treat such predictions as just a type of location recommendation, that is, they predict the next location of a user using location recommenders. However, an user usually visits somewhere for reasons other than interestingness. In this article, we propose a novel mining-based location prediction approach called Geographic-Temporal-Semantic-based Location Prediction (GTS-LP), which takes into account a user's geographic-triggered intentions, temporal-triggered intentions, and semantic-triggered intentions, to estimate the probability of the user in visiting a location. The core idea underlying our proposal is the discovery of trajectory patterns of users, namely GTS patterns, to capture frequent movements triggered by the three kinds of intentions. To achieve this goal, we define a new trajectory pattern to capture the key properties of the behaviors that are motivated by the three kinds of intentions from trajectories of users. In our GTS-LP approach, we propose a series of novel matching strategies to calculate the similarity between the current movement of a user and discovered GTS patterns based on various moving intentions. On the basis of similitude, we make an online prediction as to the location the user intends to visit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on location prediction based on trajectory pattern mining that explores the geographic, temporal, and semantic properties simultaneously. By means of a comprehensive evaluation using various real trajectory datasets, we show that our proposed GTS-LP approach delivers excellent performance and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art location prediction methods."

TI,Semantic Trajectories Modeling and Analysis
SO,ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB,"Focus on movement data has increased as a consequence of the larger availability of such data due to current GPS, GSM, RFID, and sensors techniques. In parallel, interest in movement has shifted from raw movement data analysis to more application-oriented ways of analyzing segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the application. This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility datamanagement, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i) constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics, in particular the behavioral patterns of the moving objects. Last but not least, the article surveys the new privacy issues that arise due to the semantic aspects of trajectories."

TI,Mining user similarity based on routine activities
SO,INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB,"Mobile user similarity is significant for location-based social network services. With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies, research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TI,"A unified framework for recommending items, groups and friends in social"
,media environment via mutual resource fusion
SO,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB,"Up to now, more and more online sites have started to allow their users to build the social relationships. Take the Last.fm for example (which is a popular music-sharing site), users can not only add each other as friends, but also join online interest groups where they shall meet people with common tastes. Therefore, in this environment, users might be interested in not only receiving item recommendations (such as music), but also getting friend suggestions so they might put them in the contact list, and group recommendations that they could consider joining. To support such demanding needs, in this paper, we propose a unified framework that provides three different types of recommendation in a single system: recommending items, recommending groups and recommending friends. For each type of recommendation, we in depth investigate the contribution of fusing other two auxiliary information resources (e.g., fusing friendship and membership for recommending items, and fusing user-item preferences and friendship for recommending groups) for boosting the algorithm performance. More notably, the algorithms were developed based on the matrix factorization framework in order to achieve the ideal efficiency as well as accuracy. We performed experiments with two large-scale real-world data sets that contain users' implicit interaction with items. The results revealed the effective fusion mechanism for each type of recommendation in such implicit data condition. Moreover, it demonstrates the respective merits of regularization model and factorization model: the factorization is more suitable for fusing bipartite data (such as membership and user-item preferences), while the regularization model better suits one mode data (like friendship). We further enhanced the friendship's regularization by integrating the similarity measure, which was experimentally proven with positive effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

TI,Semantic Trajectories: Mobility Data Computation and Annotation
SO,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB,"With the large-scale adoption of GPS equipped mobile sensing devices, positional data generated by moving objects (e.g., vehicles, people, animals) are being easily collected. Such data are typically modeled as streams of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points, called trajectories. In recent years trajectory management research has progressed significantly towards efficient storage and indexing techniques, as well as suitable knowledge discovery. These works focused on the geometric aspect of the raw mobility data. We are now witnessing a growing demand in several application sectors (e.g., from shipment tracking to geo-social networks) on understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects. Semantic behavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of the raw mobility data, including not only geometric patterns but also knowledge extracted jointly from the mobility data and the underlying geographic and application domains information. The core contribution of this article lies in a semantic model and a computation and annotation platform for developing a semantic approach that progressively transforms the raw mobility data into semantic trajectories enriched with segmentations and annotations. We also analyze a number of experiments we did with semantic trajectories in different domains."

AB,"Sharing geo-tagged photos has been a hot social activity in the daily life because these photos not only contain geo information but also indicate people's hobbies, intention and mobility patterns. However, the present raw geo-tagged photo routes cannot provide information as enough as complete GPS trajectories due to the defects hidden in them. This paper mainly aims at analyzing the large amounts of geo-tagged photos and proposing a novel travel route restoring method. In our approach we first propose an Interest Measure Ratio to rank the hot spots based on density-based spatial clustering arithmetic. Then we apply the Hidden Semi-Markov model and Mean Value method to demonstrate migration discipline in the hot spots and restore the significant region sequence into complete GPS trajectory. At the end of the paper, a novel experiment method is designed to demonstrate that the approach is feasible in restoring route, and there is a good performance."

The volume, growth rate, and categories of the data are analyzed, the accuracy and integrity are identified, and additional attributes of trajectories are also discussed. Statistical results indicate that the accuracy and integrity of the data is within acceptable limits.

Furthermore, we summarize several existing recommendation tasks in the mobile scenarios, such as the recommendations in the tourism domain. Finally, we discuss some key issues that are still critical in the field of context-aware mobile recommendations, including the privacy problem, the energy efficiency issues, and the design of user interfaces."

AB,"Planning travel to unfamiliar regions is a difficult task for novice travelers. The burden can be eased if the resident of the area offers to help. In this paper, we propose a social itinerary recommendation by learning from multiple user-generated digital trails, such as GPS trajectories of residents and travel experts. In order to recommend satisfying itinerary to users, we present an itinerary model in terms of attributes extracted from user-generated GPS trajectories. On top of this itinerary model, we present a social itinerary recommendation framework to find and rank itinerary candidates. We evaluated the efficiency of our recommendation method against baseline algorithms with a large set of user-generated GPS trajectories collected from Beijing, China. First, systematically generated user queries are used to compare the recommendation performance in the algorithmic level. Second, a user study involving current residents of Beijing is conducted to compare user perception and satisfaction on the recommended itinerary. Third, we compare mobile-only approach with Mobile+Cloud architecture for practical mobile recommender deployment. Lastly, we discuss personalization and adaptation factors in social itinerary recommendation throughout the paper."

AB,"Friend recommendation is a very popular application in online social network(OSN) services to help users make new friends and expand their social circle. Much of the existing research is based on either topological structure of OSN or user profiles to recommend new friends, while research based on both topological structure and user profiles to recommend potentially common friends between two undirectly connected users is still lacking. Recommending potentially common friends is useful in practical applications such as finding potential partners between two business groups in commercial social network in order to expand their business range or to reach potential customers, finding common bus stops between two specified bus stops on traffic network etc. In this paper we propose a novel shortest path based common friends recommendation approach in OSN to find and recommend potential common friends between two users. Our approach consists of the improved Floyd_Warshall algorithm and the Extended Longest Common Subsequence(ELCS) algorithm on both the topological structures of OSN and the partial profiles of users. The experiment results show that our approach can help users find the potential common friends efficiently and effectively."

AB,"With rapid growth of the GPS enabled mobile device, location-based online social network services become more and more popular, and allow their users to share life experiences with location information. In this paper, we considered a method for recommending places to a user based on spatial databases of location-based online social network services. We used a user-based collaborative filtering method to make a set of recommended places. In the proposed method, we calculate similarity of users' check-in activities not only their positions but also their semantics such as ""shopping"", ""eating"", ""drinking"", and so forth. We empirically evaluated our method in a real database and found that it outperforms the naive singular value decomposition collaborative filtering recommendation by comparing the prediction accuracy."

AB,"The Twitter lists feature was launched in late 2009 and enables the creation of curated groups containing Twitter users. Each user can be a list author and decide the basis on which other users are added to a list. The most popular lists are those that associate with a topic. Twitter lists can be used as a powerful organisation tool, but its widespread adoption has been limited. The two main obstacles are the initial setup time and the effort of continual curation. In this paper we attempt to solve the first problem by applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to construct topic-based Twitter lists. We consider k-means and affinity propagation (AP) as clustering algorithms and evaluate these algorithms using two document representation techniques. The selected representation techniques are the popular term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model. We calculate the similarities for the clustering algorithms using five well-known similarity measures that have been used extensively in the text domain. The adjusted normalised information distance (ANID) was used to compare the clustering result yielded by k-means and affinity propagation. We found that the careful selection of a similarity measure, combined with the LDA topic model can provide a user with a sensible starting point for list creation."

Due to GPS inaccuracies, inferring high level information (i.e., being at home, at work, in a restaurant) from geographic coordinates in still non trivial. In this paper we use information about activities being performed by the user to improve location recognition accuracy. Unlike traditional methods, relations between locations and activities are not extracted from training data but from an external commonsense knowledge base. Our approach maps location and activity labels to concepts organized within the Concept Net network. Then, it verifies their commonsense proximity by implementing a bio-inspired greedy algorithm. Experimental results show a sharp increase in localization accuracy."

Under the circumstances of trajectory-centric LBSN, we then explore two fundamental research points concerned with understanding users in terms of their locations. One is modeling the location history of an individual using the individual's trajectory data. The other is estimating the similarity between two different people according to their location histories. The inferred similarity represents the strength of connection between two users in a location-based social network, and can enable friend recommendations and community discovery. The general approaches for evaluating these applications are also presented."

A series of research topics are presented, with respect to mining the collective social knowledge from many users' GPS trajectories to facilitate travel. On the one hand, the generic travel recommendations provide a user with the most interesting locations, travel sequences, and travel experts in a region, as well as an effective itinerary conditioned by a user's starting location and an available time length. On the other hand, the personalized travel recommendations find the locations matching an individual's interests, which can be learned from the individual's historical data."

AB,"Recently, several high-speed applications have been emerged for personal"
,"communication service (PCS) networks. Therefore, locating mobile"
,terminals (MTs) as they move from one place to another is the key to
,provide continuous services with unrestricted mobility. To maintain the
,"continuity of service during handoffs, PCS involves the need to predict"
,MTs' movements to cope with resource limitations and heterogeneity.
,Predicting MT's next location in PCS networks has become an inherently
,interesting and challenging problem. If we can correctly predict the
,"next cell to which MTs are going, the performance of wireless"
,"applications, such as call admission control, QoS, and mobility"
,management can be improved as well. Mobility prediction based on MTs'
,movement history has become an effective mean not only to decrease
,"call-dropping probability, but also to shorten the handover latency."
,"However, applying various basic prediction schemes to realistic"
,"environments has reported several limitations. Moreover, the randomness"
,"of MT's motion prevents the accurate prediction. In this paper, a Hybrid"
,Mobility Prediction (HMP) strategy has been proposed. HMP provides
,flexible usage of the limited resources of PCS networks. It combines
,"evidence from three different predictors, which are; probabilistic"
,"predictor (PP), group-based predictor (GP), and spatial predictor (SP)."
,"PP relies on Bayes theorem, GP uses ant colony optimization (ACO), while"
,SP tries to detect the topological architecture of the current
,registration area to enhance the prediction process. HMP provides high
,"accurate prediction of the next cell to which an MT is going, which"
,avoids over reservation resulting in a waste of resources. Experimental
,results have shown that HMP outperforms recent prediction strategies as
,the amount of reserved resources is dynamically adjusted based on the
,predicted cell.

,trafficking is a shame on Humanity. As per the report of Human Rights
,"commission of India over 40,000 children are reported missing every year"
,of which 11000 are untraced [1][2]. Another statics report saying 80% of
,human trafficking is done for sexual exploitation and rest is for bonded
,labors [2]. Sex traffickers often find pray as children because not only
,"children are vulnerable than adults, but there is a high market demand"
,for young victims. Traffickers target victims most often after school
,programs. It is a painful truth that India is considered as a hub for
,Human trafficking in Asia [2]. Even though it is difficult to eradicate
,"the shame on human society, Here is a small initiative to reduce child"
,trafficking by providing a child safety system.
,"Apart from child security, as a Parent we have to consider and"
,contribute in child education too. There is an ample amount of gap
,between Parent-Child-Education-Teacher. Parent have no clue how to
,contribute to their child education. How to bring focus to child in
,education and life. Vital factor of this is parent are busy with their

,teacher it is difficult to do individual care for every student they
,hold. In olden days the teacher and student ratio will be minimal but it
,"is not the same case now. Even UGC is suggesting a norm of 1:25 ratio,"
,but most of the educational institutions are not completely following it
,[4]. This leads to minimal interaction between students and teachers.
,The focus of this project is to deploy security system in hot spots like
,"School, Home, Tuition centre and also in school buses or students own"
,vehicle like bicycles etc.. The system comprise of RFID/NFC
,communication enabled smart Id card and a Child Safety device(CSD). The
,CSD is the combination of most commonly used technologies like GPS/GSM
,and RFID. The device communicates with the servers via GSM or internet

AB,Large scale disasters cause severe social disorder and trigger mass
,evacuation activities. Managing the evacuation shelters efficiently is
,"crucial for disaster management. Kumamoto prefecture, Japan, was hit by"
,"an enormous (Magnitude 7.3) earthquake on 16th of April, 2016. As a"
,"result, more than 10,000 buildings were severely damaged and over"
,"100,000 people had to evacuate from their homes. After the earthquake,"
,it took the decision makers several days to grasp the locations where
,"people were evacuating, which delayed of distribution of supply and"
,rescue. This situation was made even more complex since some people
,evacuated to places that were not designated as evacuation shelters.
,Conventional methods for grasping evacuation hotspots require on-foot
,field surveys that take time and are difficult to execute right after
,the hazard in the confusion.
,We propose a novel framework to efficiently estimate the evacuation
,hotspots after large disasters using location data collected from
,smartphones. To validate our framework and show the useful analysis
,"using our output, we demonstrated the framework on the Kumamoto"
,earthquake using GPS data of smartphones collected by Yahoo Japan. We
,verified that our estimation accuracy of evacuation hotspots were very
,high by checking the located facilities and also by comparing the
,"population transition results with newspaper reports. Additionally, we"
,demonstrated analysis using our framework outputs that would help
,"decision makers, such as the population transition and function period"
,of each hotspot. The efficiency of our framework is also validated by
,"checking the processing time, showing that it could be utilized"
,efficiently in disasters of any scale. Our framework provides useful
,output for decision makers that manage evacuation shelters after various
,kinds of large scale disasters.

AB,VANETs have attracted researchers' attention lately because of the need
,to promote the driving experience by extending the drivers' view through
,wireless data exchange. Mobility prediction enables appealing proactive
,experiences for a wide range of VANET location-aware services and
,"applications. In this work, we present more than a destination"
,prediction technique. We introduce a mechanism for transforming the
,vehicles into smart entities based on a four dimensional model for
,destination prediction. The model comprises all possible aspects
,"affecting the human mobility including time, social network and"
,"locations preference. Moreover, it takes the lead in leveraging the"
,semantic properties of both the points of interest and the social
,relations to affect the visiting activities of the drivers. The
,experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly
,outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches achieving an average
,"accuracy of 90%. In addition, the presented approach lays the groundwork"
,for a realistic mobility model capable of simulating the mobility
,"activities of an input social network with great precision,"
,independently of any input trace.

,of research. Mobility models play an important role particularly in
,assessing the simulative performance of mobile and opportunistic
,"networks. The mobility traces, which most of these models are based on,"
,"however, mostly suffer from several shortcomings. In this paper, we use"
,the extensive Lausanne Data Collection Campaign (LDCC) mobility trace as
,basis for further map-oriented processing. Map-matching and sensible
,addition of optimal routes between points mitigate problems like GPS
,"spatial noise, anonymization, and data gaps. Moreover, stay point"
,extraction is performed as a preparation for the analysis of elemental
,statistical mobility characteristics. An exemplary impact evaluation of
,contact statistics shows that the resulting map-oriented trace basis is

AB,Human mobility prediction in ubiquitous computing is the ability of a
,system to forecast the anticipated movement of an individual or a group
,of persons. This interdisciplinary problem has gained traction in fields
,of academic and industrial research mainly because it is fundamental to
,achieving system efficiency and marketing efficacy in many applications.
,This study seeks to develop a novel heuristic technique that predicts
,the actual geo-spatial locations associated with the most probable
,semantic tags of locations (e.g. restaurant) that individuals are likely
,"to visit. The intuition of this work lies in the fact that, for any"
,given probable future semantic tag there exists multiple geo-spatial
,"locations associated with it, hence the need to disambiguate the actual"
,"destination location. We develop an algorithm STS-predict, that exploits"
,the spatio-temporal relationships between the current location of a
,target individual and candidate geo-spatial locations associated with
,future semantic tags to predict the actual destination location. We
,evaluate our approach on a real world GPS trajectory dataset.

,Act of 2014. While mobile phones can restrict the explicit access to

,"knowledge, using gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer information."
,We modeled this problem as a maximum likelihood route identification on
,a graph. The graph is generated from the OpenStreetMap publicly
,available database of roads. Our route identification algorithms output
,both a ranked list of potential routes as well a ranked list of
,"route-clusters. Through extensive simulations over 11 cities, we show"
,that for most cities with probability higher than 50% it is possible to
,output a short list of 10 routes containing the traveled route. In real
,driving experiments (over 980 Km) in the cities of Boston (resp.
,"Waltham), Massachusetts, we report a probability of 30% (resp. 60%) of"
,inferring a list of 10 routes containing the true route.

AB,In this paper we present the case study on application of data mining
,"techniques like clustering, regression and scoring with heuristic"
,measures for the largest social event prognosis based on spatiotemporal
,data. The aim of this analysis is to propose the methodology that bases
,on archival records and is capable to predict the place where the
,largest social event will take place and who will be a host ( organizer)
,of it. For this goal we utilize the part of geocaching community data.
,The dataset we used is consisted of 755 events that happened from
,2010-01-30 to 2015-09-05 in Poland organized by 282 distinct users.
,Basing on archival data of past four years we were capable to indicate
,not only the region in which the biggest event took place but also its
,host and its place within range of 700 meters. Our new algorithm and its
,application to geocaching events data is main novelty of this paper.

AB,This paper puts forward a method that automatically detects trips and
,trip segments with data on the instantaneous movement attributes of
,individuals that can be collected automatically by smartphone sensors.
,The goal is to enhance the accuracy of the data collected through the
,better identification of single-mode trips and trip segments while
,minimizing the participant's involvement and preserving battery life.
,The proposed method works independently of data from external sources
,and can be implemented in smartphone applications to enhance the
,accuracy of the data that are collected and minimize the amount of data
,that need to be transferred. The method consists of a combination of
,real-time processing and postprocessing of the data and incorporates a
,"series of rules to clean, split, and merge trips and trip segments, if"
,required. The performance of the model was evaluated in a real-world
,"experiment, in which it achieved an overall accuracy of 97% for the"
,detection of trips from records of daily tracks. The analysis of the
,results shows that the implementation of the trip detection model
,increased the proportion of nonmotorized trips detected by 6%. In
,"addition, the implementation of the model increased the accuracy of the"
,data on the duration and the length of the recorded trips.

,the convenient mass transportation such as subway and buses already
,"existing; many people in the Seoul city, Republic of Korea also use a"
,taxi as transportation mode in their daily activity. The problem still

,basic information of taxi passenger distribution in Seoul city. The data
,is analyzed using multidimensional analyzed where the parameter
,"location, time and frequency are mainly used. The general taxi passenger"
,distribution result shows that Gangnam district got the highest number
,"of passenger; especially from Teheran street. From the specific area,"
,Dongdaemun market also give the high contribution of taxi passenger
,where around 25 % are used taxi when many people went out to shopping.
,The riding time analysis result shows that 30 % of passengers are rode
,the taxi in short time and use inside their district only; not across to
,"the others district. Using this basic information, the taxi company can"
,consider and manage their taxi dispatching location to increase the

AB,Rooted in the philosophy of point-and segment-based approaches for
,"transportation mode segmentation of trajectories, the measures that"
,researchers have adopted to evaluate the quality of the results (1) are
,"incomparable across approaches, hence slowing the progress in the field"
,and (2) do not provide insight about the quality of the continuous
,"transportation mode segmentation. To address these problems, this paper"
,proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a
,continuous transportation mode segmentation model performs. The error
,measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous
,"intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the"
,alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the
,corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing
,errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic
,"transportation mode segmentation approaches (implicit,"
,"explicit-holistic, and explicit-consensus-based transport mode"
,"segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture."
,Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the
,"superiority of explicit-consensus-based transport mode segmentation,"
,which can be attributed to the explicit modeling of segments and
,"transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex"
,learning task.

AB,"This article describes iDiary, a system that takes as input GPS data"
,streams generated by users' phones and turns them into textual
,descriptions of the trajectories. The system features a user interface
,similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their
,"activities (e.g., ""Where did I buy books?"") and receive textual answers"
,based on their GPS signals. iDiary uses novel algorithms for semantic
,compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS signals in parallel
,to compute the critical locations of a user. We encode these problems as
,follows. The k-segment mean is a k-piecewise linear function that
,"minimizes the regression distance to the signal. The (k, m)-segment mean"
,has an additional constraint that the projection of the k segments on
,R-d consists of only m <= k segments. A coreset for this problem is a
,smart compression of the input signal that allows computation of a (1 +
,"epsilon)-approximation to its k-segment or (k, m)-segment mean in O(nlog"
,"n) time for arbitrary constants e, k, and m. We use coresets to obtain a"
,"parallel algorithm that scans the signal in one pass, using space and"
,update time per point that is polynomial in log n. Using an external
,"database, we then map these locations to textual descriptions and"
,activities so that we can apply text mining techniques on the resulting
,"data (e.g., LSA or transportation mode recognition). We provide"
,experimental results for both the system and algorithms and compare them
,to existing commercial and academic state of the art. This is the first

AB,Human mobility patterns can provide valuable information in
,understanding the impact of human behavioral regularities in urban
,"systems, usually with a specific focus on traffic prediction, public"
,health or urban planning. While existing studies on human movement have
,placed huge emphasis on spatial location to predict where people go
,"next, the time dimension component is usually being treated with"
,oversimplification or even being neglected. Time dimension is crucial to
,"understanding and detecting human activity changes, which play a"
,negative role in prediction and thus may affect the predictive accuracy.
,This study aims to predict human movement from a spatio-temporal
,perspective by taking into account the impact of activity changes. We
,analyze and define changes of human activity and propose an algorithm to
,"detect such changes, based on which a Markov chain model is used to"
,predict human movement. The Microsoft GeoLife dataset is used to test
,"our methodology, and the data of two selected users is used to evaluate"
,the performance of the prediction. We compare the predictive accuracy
,(R-2) derived from the data with and without implementing the activity
,change detection. The results show that the R-2 is improved from 0.295
,to 0.762 for the user with obvious activity changes and from 0.965 to
,0.971 for the user without obvious activity changes. The method proposed
,by this study improves the accuracy in analyzing and predicting human
,movement and lays the foundation for related urban studies.

,"activity-based transportation demand forecasting. In this research, a"
,two-step methodology for identifying activity stop locations is
,"proposed. In the first step, an improved density-based spatial"
,clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm identifies stop
,"points and moving points; then in the second step, the support vector"
,machines (SVMs) method distinguishes activity stops from non-activity
,stops among the identified stop points. A time sequence constraint and a
,direction change constraint are applied as improvements to DBSCAN
,(yielding an improved algorithm known as C-DBSCAN). Then three major
,"features are extracted for use in the SVMs method: stop duration, mean"
,"distance to the centroid of a cluster of points at a stop location, and"
,the shorter of distances from current location to home and to the
,workplace. The proposed methodology was tested using GPS data collected
,from mobile phones in the Nagoya area of Japan. The C-DBSCAN algorithm
,achieves an accuracy of 90 % in identifying stop points in the first
,"step, while the SVMs method is 96 % accurate in distinguishing the"
,locations of activity stops from non-activity stops in the second step.
,Compared to other variants of DBSCAN used to identify activity locations
,"from GPS trajectories, this two-step method is generally superior."

AB,Extracting meaningful information from the growing quantity of spatial
,data is a challenge. The issues are particularly evident with
,spatio-temporal data describing movement. Such data typically
,"corresponds to movement of humans, animals and machines in the physical"
,environment. This article considers a special form of movement data
,generated through human-computer interactions with online web maps. As a
,"user interacts with a web map using a mouse as a pointing tool,"
,invisible trajectories are generated. By examining the spatial features
,"on the map where the mouse cursor visits, a user's interests and"
,"experience can be detected. To analyse this valuable information, we"
,have developed a geovisual analysis tool which provides a rich insight
,into such user behaviour. The focus of this paper is on a clustering
,technique which we apply to mouse trajectories to group trajectories
,with similar behavioural properties. Our experiments reveal that it is
,possible to identify experienced and novice users of web mapping
,environments using an incremental clustering approach. The results can
,be used to provide personalised map interfaces to users and provide
,appropriate interventions for completing spatial tasks.

AB,"In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), effective prediction of time-varying"

,interference prediction in MANETs with a finite number of nodes by
,proposing and using a general-order linear model for node mobility. The
,proposed mobility model can well approximate node dynamics of practical
,"MANETs. In contrast to previous studies on interference statistics, we"
,are able through this model to give a best estimate of the time-varying

,"Specifically, we propose a compound Gaussian point process functional as"

,moment-generating function of the interference prediction. With a series
,"form of this functional, we give the necessary and sufficient condition"
,for when the prediction is essentially equivalent to that from a
,binomial point process (BPP) network in the limit as time goes to
,infinity. These conditions permit one to rigorously determine when the

AB,Massive and passive data such as cell phone traces provide samples of
,the whereabouts and movements of individuals. These are a potential
,source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main
,challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are
,"sparsely sampled in time, which requires a precise set of techniques for"
,mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a
,method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by
,"analyzing relational signatures of activity time, duration, and land"
,"use. First, we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a"
,"robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second,"
,we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains
,with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies
,"between activity type, trip scheduling, and land use types via a"
,Relational Markov Network. We apply the method to two different kinds of
,"mobile phone datasets from the metropolitan areas of Vienna, Austria and"
,"Boston, USA. The former data includes information from mobility"
,"management signals, while the latter are usual Call Detail Records. The"
,resulting trip sequence patterns and activity scheduling from both
,"datasets agree well with their respective city surveys, and we show that"
,the inferred activity clusters are stable across different days and both
,cities. This method to infer activity patterns from cell phone data
,allows us to use these as a novel and cheaper data source for
,activity-based modeling and travel behavior studies.

AB,Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging
,location-based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and
,targeted advertising according to destinations. A common approach to
,destination prediction is to derive the probability of a location being
,"the destination based on historical trajectories. However, almost all"
,the existing techniques use various kinds of extra information such as
,"road network, proprietary travel planner, statistics requested from"
,"government, and personal driving habits. Such extra information, in most"
,"circumstances, is unavailable or very costly to obtain. Thereby we"
,approach the task of destination prediction by using only historical
,"trajectory dataset. However, this approach encounters the ""data sparsity"
,"problem"", i.e., the available historical trajectories are far from"
,"enough to cover all possible query trajectories, which considerably"
,limits the number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted
,destinations. We propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis
,(SubSyn) to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn first decomposes
,historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two adjacent
,"locations, and then connects the sub-trajectories into ""synthesised"""
,trajectories. This process effectively expands the historical trajectory
,dataset to contain much more trajectories. Experiments based on real
,datasets show that SubSyn can predict destinations for up to ten times
,more query trajectories than a baseline prediction algorithm.
,"Furthermore, the running time of the SubSyn-training algorithm is almost"
,"negligible for a large set of 1.9 million trajectories, and the"
,SubSyn-prediction algorithm runs over two orders of magnitude faster
,than the baseline prediction algorithm constantly.

AB,Geo-spatial data with geographical information explodes as the
,development of GPS-devices. The data contains certain patterns of users.
,"To dig out the patterns behind the data efficiently, a grid-growing"
,clustering algorithm is introduced. The proposed algorithm takes use of
,"a grid structure, and a novel clustering operation is presented, which"
,considers a grid growing method on the grid structure. The grid
,"structure brings the benefit of efficiency. For large geo-spatial data,"
,the algorithm has competitive strength on the running time. The total
,"time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), where the time"
,complexity mainly comes from the seed selection step. The grid-growing
,clustering algorithm is useful when the number of clusters is unknown
,since the algorithm requires no parameter on the number of clusters. The
,"clusters detected could have arbitrary shapes. Furthermore, sparse areas"
,are treated as outliers/noises in the algorithm. An empirical study on
,several data sets indicates that the proposed algorithm works much more
,efficiently than other popular clustering algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier

,"GPSTracker1 a prototype application for Android phones, which collects"
,"position, speed, altitude and time information and performs real-time"
,classification of user's movement. The GPSTracker application also uses
,geo-location information abouts Points Of Interest (POIs) such as bus or

,unprecedented foundation for understanding human behaviour. With a
,"record of historic movement, in the form of geospatial trajectories,"
,extracting locations meaningful to users is commonly performed as a
,basis for modelling a users' interactions with their environment.
,"Existing literature, however, has scarcely considered the applicability"
,"of extracted locations, typically focusing solely on the consequent"
,"knowledge acquisition process employed, due to the difficulty of"
,evaluating the output of such unsupervised learning techniques. Towards
,"the goal of ensuring the representativeness of extracted locations, and"
,"using location prediction as an example knowledge acquisition process,"
,this work provides a method of automated parameter selection for both
,location extraction and prediction that ensures both the applicability
,of the locations extracted and the utility of the predictions performed.
,"Specifically, we: (i) provide a metric for the evaluation of both"
,extracted locations and predictions that characterises the goal of each
,"of these tasks, (ii) frame the process of parameter selection as that of"
,"mathematical optimisation through the presented metric, and (iii)"

AB,We look into the realization of mobile crowdsensing campaigns that draw
,"on the opportunistic networking paradigm, as practised in delay-tolerant"
,networks but also in the emerging device-to-device communication mode in
,"cellular networks. In particular, we ask how mobile users can be"
,optimally selected in order to generate the required space-time paths
,across the network for collecting data from a set of fixed locations.
,"The users hold different roles in these paths, from collecting data with"
,their sensing-enabled devices to relaying them across the network and
,uploading them to data collection points with Internet connectivity. We
,first consider scenarios with deterministic node mobility and formulate
,the selection of users as a minimum-cost set cover problem with a
,submodular objective function. We then generalize to more realistic
,settings with uncertainty about the user mobility. A methodology is
,devised for translating the statistics of individual user mobility to
,statistics of space-time path formation and feeding them to the set
,cover problem formulation. We describe practical greedy heuristics for
,the resulting NP-hard problems and compute their approximation ratios.
,Our experimentation with real mobility datasets (a) illustrates the
,"multiple tradeoffs between the campaign cost and duration, the bound on"
,"the hopcount of space-time paths, and the number of collection points;"
,and (b) provides evidence that in realistic problem instances the
,heuristics perform much better than what their pessimistic worst-case
,bounds suggest.

AB,We present a place-history-based activity prediction system called

,that are highly likely to occur given a series of information about
,activities done before or activity-related contextual information such
,"as visit place and time. To predict the activities, we develop a"
,causality-based activity prediction model using Bayesian networks. The
,basic idea of the prediction is that where a person has been and what
,he/she has done so far influence what he/she will do next. To show the

,"Time-Use Survey (ATUS) dataset, which includes more than 10,000 people's"
,location and activity history. Our evaluation shows that Agatha can
,predict users' potential activities with up to 90% accuracy for the top

AB,Purpose - The aim of this paper is to empirically examine how to best
,"incorporate such contextual data, such as location or the semantic place"
,"of mobile users, into mobile user behavior models. Acquiring such data"
,has become technically easier than ever. The proper utilization of these
,"data leads, hypothetically, to better understanding of mobile user"
,"behavior and, consequently, to enhanced mobile services."
,"Design/methodology/approach - The paper systematically compares, under"
,"multiple experimental settings, the predictive performances of models"
,"built with three different approaches (pre-filtering, contextual"
,modeling and post-filtering) used for incorporating contextual data into
,user behavior models. The comparisons focus on by which approach
,additional semantic place information can be best utilized for making
,the most accurate inferences on mobile user behavior. Real-life
,smartphone usage data are utilized in the analysis.
,Findings - The results demonstrate that none of the considered
,approaches uniformly dominate the others across all experimental
,"settings. However, they show circumstance specific differences that need"
,to be aligned with practical use cases for the best performance.
,Practical implications - Identifying the most suitable approaches for
,utilizing the semantic place (and other contextual) data is an important
,"practical problem for electronic service providers, whose offerings are"
,increasingly moving to the mobile domain and thus need to respond to the
,demands of mobility.
,Originality/value - The paper constitutes an initial step toward
,understanding and systematically evaluating different approaches for
,incorporating semantic place data into modeling mobile user behavior.
,Practitioners in the mobile service domain can apply the initial results
,and academics build upon them with more diverse experimental settings.

AB,Context prediction plays a vital role in an assistive ubiquitous
,environment. The environmental configuration in a ubiquitous environment
,is heavily dependent on the context of the events occurring in the
,environment. Current state of the art approaches utilize the user's
,history information for predicting the context of the events. When the
,user's history does not provide apposite contextual information for the
,"observed activity/event at time t, the history based state of the art"
,context prediction techniques fails to predict the appropriate future
,context. To overcome the gap of missing context information in the
,"user's context history, we propose a Profile based Collaborative Context"
,Prediction (PCCP) approach. PCCP is a predictive association rules based
,system which utilizes the history of similar users and collaborate among
,users of the ubiquitous environment. PCCP generates rules at high level
,"of abstraction, human readable and understandable that helps in avoiding"
,"the underline details. To evaluate the PCCP, a smart office is"
,considered as an experimental environment. Experiments are carried out
,on indigenous multi user smart office data set. Our experiments showed
,significant level of accuracy in both environments. Due to the

AB,Location-based social network has received much attention recently. It
,provides rich information of social and spatial context for researchers
,to study users' behaviors from different aspects. A number of recent
,"efforts focus on recommending locations, users, activities, and social"
,"medias for users. Unlike previous works, we intend to make"
,"recommendations for vendors, assisting vendors in finding potential"
,customers in location-based social network. We propose a framework to
,recommend potential customers to vendors (called RPCV) in location-based
,social network effectively and efficiently. To find the best set of
,"customers, RPCV takes both spatial relations and user preference into"
,"consideration. A reverse spatial-preference kRanks algorithm, which"
,"effectively combines spatial relations with user preference, is also"
,proposed. Our experimental results on real datasets from Foursquare and
,Brightkite show that our framework has higher performance than other
,state-of-the-art approaches.

AB,Location is one of the most commonly used contextual information in
,mobile context-aware systems. It can be considered on many different
,"levels of granularity, varying from geolocation that is based on GPS"
,"systems, up to microlocation that uses Bluetooth Low Energy devices and"
,WiFi access points for locating users inside buildings. Most common use
,"of location is navigation, however recently it is more often considered"
,also as an important component of the user profile. One of the biggest
,challenges in location-based context-aware systems is the discovery of
,patterns in user transportation traces and extraction of the most often
,visited places. In this paper we presented and evaluated a method that
,allows for automatic extraction of clusters from user location traces.
,"These clusters represents user points of interest like home, work,"
,"favourite restaurants, but also transportation routines. The original"
,contribution of this work is a proposal of an approach based on the
,K-means clustering algorithm equipped with a module for automatic
,discovery of number of clusters and density-based cluster merging. This
,"method allows for online, adaptable discovery of user points of"

AB,Immense amount of data containing information about preferences of users
,can be shared with the help of WWW and mobile devices. The pervasiveness
,of location acquisition technologies like Global Positioning System
,(GPS) has enabled the convenient logging of movement histories of users.
,GPS logs are good source to extract information about user's preferences
,"and interests. In this paper, we first aim to discover and learn"
,individual user's preferences for various locations they have visited in
,the past by analyzing and mining the user's GPS logs. We have used the
,GPS trajectory dataset of 178 users collected by Microsoft Research
,Asia's GeoLife project collected in a period of over four years. These
,preferences are further used to predict individual's interest in an
,unvisited location. We have proposed a novel approach based on Genetic
,Algorithm (GA) to model the interest of user for unvisited location. The
,two approaches have been implemented using Java and MATLAB and the
,results are compared for evaluation. The recommendation results of
,proposed approach are comparable with matrix factorization based
,approach and shows improvement of 4.1 % (approx.) on average root mean
,squared error (RMSE).

AB,Mobile Opportunistic Network (MON) is characterized by intermittent
,connectivity where communication largely depends on the mobility pattern
,"of the participating nodes. In MON, a node can take the custody of a"
,packet for a long time and carry it until a new forwarding path has been
,"established, unlike mobile adhoc network (MANET), where a node must drop"
,"the packet otherwise. Therefore, routing in MON depends on the repeated"
,"make-and-break of communication links, which again depends on the"
,mobility of the nodes as they encounter and drift away from each other.
,MONs can simply be formed by humans carrying hand-held devices (like
,Personal Digital Assistant [PDAs] or cell phones) or on-board devices
,"installed in vehicles. Therefore, with mobility playing a major role in"
,"the performance of MON, researchers have repeatedly tried to understand"
,"the nature of mobility with respect to humans, vehicles, and wild"
,"animals. To study the nature of mobility, researchers have collected"
,"mobility traces, proposed mobility models, and analyzed the performance"
,of MON with respect to various mobility parameters. This article
,provides a detailed survey of different mobility models which have been
,proposed to date and how mobility largely determines the performance of
,opportunistic routing. We divide the article into four major sections.
,"First, we provide a detailed survey of all the synthetic mobility models"
,"which have been developed to date. Second, we study the various mobility"
,"traces which have been collected and analyzed. Third, we study how"
,"mobility parameters affect the performance of MON. Finally, we highlight"
,on some of the research areas and open challenges which yet remain
,unsolved.

,"each day of the week. Once factored out this weekly pattern, user"
,mobility among points of interest is postulated to be markovian. We

,infectious disease models. Location-aware technologies such as Global
,Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices are used increasingly as a gold
,standard for mobility research. The main goal of this observational
,study was to compare and contrast the information obtained through GPS
,and semi-structured interviews (SSI) to assess issues affecting data
,"quality and, ultimately, our ability to measure fine-scale human"
,"mobility. A total of 160 individuals, ages 7 to 74, from Iquitos, Peru,"
,were tracked using GPS data-loggers for 14 days and later interviewed
,"using the SSI about places they visited while tracked. A total of 2,047"
,"and 886 places were reported in the SSI and identified by GPS,"
,respectively. Differences in the concordance between methods occurred by
,"location type, distance threshold (within a given radius to be"
,"considered a match) selected, GPS data collection frequency (i.e., 30,"
,90 or 150 seconds) and number of GPS points near the SSI place
,considered to define a match. Both methods had perfect concordance
,"identifying each participant's house, followed by 80-100% concordance"
,"for identifying schools and lodgings, and 50-80% concordance for"
,residences and commercial and religious locations. As the distance
,"threshold selected increased, the concordance between SSI and raw GPS"
,data increased (beyond 20 meters most locations reached their maximum
,concordance). Processing raw GPS data using a signal-clustering
,algorithm decreased overall concordance to 14.3%. The most common causes
,of discordance as described by a sub-sample (n = 101) with whom we
,"followed-up were GPS units being accidentally off (30%), forgetting or"
,"purposely not taking the units when leaving home (24.8%), possible"
,barriers to the signal (4.7%) and leaving units home to recharge (4.6%).
,We provide a quantitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of
,both methods for capturing fine-scale human mobility.

AB,Recent developments in pervasive location acquisition technologies
,provide the technical support for massive collection of trajectory data.
,Activity locations identified from trajectory data can be used to
,"evaluate space-time activity patterns. However, the studies that explore"
,activity patterns at collective levels often fail to address the
,"temporal aspect. The traditional spatial statistics, which are commonly"
,"used for spatial pattern analysis, are limited in describing space-time"
,interactions. This paper proposes a method to detect the dynamics of
,space-time development of urban activity patterns that are embedded in
,large volume trajectory data. Taxi cabs' trajectory data in the city of
,"San Francisco were analyzed to identify activity instances, activity hot"
,"spots, and space-time dynamics of activity hot spots. The urban activity"
,"hot spots, evolving through different stages and across the city,"
,provide a comprehensive depiction of the space-time activity patterns in
,the urban landscape. The dynamic patterns of the activity hot spots can
,be used to retrieve historical events and to predict future activity hot
,"spots, which may be valuable for transportation and public safety"

AB,Travel recommendation and travel diary generation applications can
,benefit significantly from methods that infer the durations and
,"locations of visits from travelers' GPS data. However, conventional"
,"inference methods, which cluster GPS points on the basis of their"
,"spatial distance, are not suited to inferring visit durations. This"
,paper presents a pace-based clustering method to infer visit locations
,and durations. The method contributes two novel techniques: (1) It
,clusters GPS points logged during visits by considering the speed and
,"applying a probabilistic density function for each trip. Consequently,"
,it avoids clustering GPS points that are near but unrelated to visits.
,(2) It also includes additional GPS points in the clusters by
,"considering their temporal sequence. As a result, it is able to complete"
,the clusters with GPS points that are far from the visits but are logged
,"during the visits, caused, for example, by GPS noise indoors. The"
,results of an experimental evaluation comparing our proposed method with
,three published inference methods indicate that our proposed method
,"infers the duration of a visit with an average error rate of 8.7%,"
,notably outperforming the other methods.

AB,Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer
,users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services
,usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names
,automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context
,"for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we"
,proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically
,provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In
,"particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her"
,"physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate"
,"semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location"
,"naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to"
,propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location
,"naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial"
,"preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging"
,"learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of"
,"5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from"
,Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three
,"components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus"
,it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as
,"discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated"
,"with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP"
,outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names
,"for 23.6% and 26.6% of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai,"
,respectively.

AB,The main objective of this work was the development of a new modelling
,tool for quantification of human exposure to traffic-related air
,pollution within distinct microenvironments by using a novel approach
,"for trajectory analysis of the individuals. For this purpose, mobile"
,phones with Global Positioning System technology have been used to
,collect daily trajectories of the individuals with higher temporal
,"resolution and a trajectory data mining, and geo-spatial analysis"
,algorithm was developed and implemented within a Geographical
,Information System to obtain time-activity patterns. These data were
,combined with air pollutant concentrations estimated for several
,"microenvironments. In addition to outdoor, pollutant concentrations in"
,distinct indoor microenvironments are characterised using a
,probabilistic approach. An example of the application for PM2.5 is
,presented and discussed. The results obtained for daily average
,individual exposure correspond to a mean value of 10.6 and 6.0-16.4 mu g
,m(-3) in terms of 5th-95th percentiles. Analysis of the results shows
,that the use of point air quality measurements for exposure assessment
,will not explain the intra- and inter-variability of individuals'
,exposure levels. The methodology developed and implemented in this work
,provides time-sequence of the exposure events thus making possible
,association of the exposure with the individual activities and delivers

AB,Sensor-enabled smartphones are opening a new frontier in the development
,of mobile sensing applications. The recognition of human activities and
,context from sensor data using classification models underpins these
,"emerging applications. However, conventional approaches to training"
,classifiers struggle to cope with the diverse user populations routinely
,found in large-scale popular mobile applications. Differences between
,"users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse"
,"classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we"
,"propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates"
,inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training
,"process. Under CSN, every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to"
,their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor data to
,personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users.
,This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different
,dimensions of inter-person similarity. Our experiments show CSN
,outperforms existing approaches to classifier training under the
,presence of population diversity.

AB,The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in
,"recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between"
,users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS
,trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie
,"between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations."
,Different from previous work using social structures or directly
,"matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS"
,"trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping"
,"malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between"
,different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm.
,"The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries"
,more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic
,"positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two"
,"users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in"
,"different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential"
,"property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We"
,evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109
,users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a
,physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several
,widely used sequence matching approaches given this application

AB,Sensing and computational capabilities in smartphones are enabling
,attractive new applications in the area of location aware systems.
,Location aware devices can accurately compute their physical location in
,the form of latitude and longitude. However places contain much more
,valuable information to user rather than coordinates. A place is
,important to a user's personal daily life and carries socially important
,"meanings to a user such as a place where one studies, works, eats, lives"
,etc. GPS enabled devices like smartphones and tablets use location as a
,context in applications to share their current location. A GPS log of a
,moving object contains time stamped latitude and longitude information.
,The discovery of a user's places is a key challenge and involves mapping
,of GPS data log to meaningful personally important places. In this
,"paper, we propose an algorithm that extracts a user's personally"
,"important places from location traces, and evaluate the algorithm with"
,real user's data.

AB,Location Based Services (LBS) are evolving very fast but despite this
,are still at an early phase of their evolution. The future LBS services
,will be more anticipatory of users needs and will exploit a broader
,"range of information on users. In order to anticipate users' needs, LBS"
,"providers should be able to understand users' behaviours, preferences"
,and interests automatically and without asking the user to specify them.
,Then using the user's current situation and previously extracted
,"behaviours, interests and dislikes, the user's needs can be predicted at"
,the relevant moment and provide the most appropriate sets of services.
,This paper shows the application of data mining techniques over
,anonymous sets of tracking data to recognise mobility behaviours and
,preferences of users such as Point of Interest (PoI). Tracking data are
,"first anonymised then stored in a spatio-temporal database. Then, using"
,"data mining techniques, rules, models and patterns are recognised. Such"
,"knowledge, patterns and models are subsequently used for intelligent"
,navigation services as input making suggestions.

,Our framework provides a physical activity scale based on typical energy

,"estimates the energy expenditure, we use typical value of metabolic"
,equivalents to task (MET) which is used as practical scale. Unlike the
,"other studies for monitoring physical activity, we estimate the type of"
,user's activity using facility information which are obtained from road
,map and land-use/land-cover map. To confirm the feasibility of our
,"approach, we have conducted a long-term experiment on monitoring the"
,"activity of elderly people living in less-populated area. As a result,"
,our framework provides good summarization of daily activities of

,mining from big data. The particular problem of interest is the
,effective mining of long sequences from large-scale location data to be
,"practical for Reality Mining applications, which suffer from large"
,"amounts of noise and lack of ground truth. To address this complex data,"
,we propose an unsupervised probabilistic topic model called the distant
,n-gram topic model (DNTM). The DNTM is based on latent Dirichlet
,"allocation (LDA), which is extended to integrate sequential information."
,"We define the generative process for the model, derive the inference"
,"procedure, and evaluate our model on both synthetic data and real mobile"
,phone data. We consider two different mobile phone datasets containing
,"natural human mobility patterns obtained by location sensing, the first"
,considering GPS/wi-fi locations and the second considering cell tower
,connections. The DNTM discovers meaningful topics on the synthetic data
,"as well as the two mobile phone datasets. Finally, the DNTM is compared"
,"to LDA by considering log-likelihood performance on unseen data, showing"
,the predictive power of the model. The results show that the DNTM
,consistently outperforms LDA as the sequence length increases.

AB,The use of web services for analysing and visualising maps has received
,"great attention recently, because the complicated analysis of spatial"
,data requires different processes to be run consecutively. Predicting
,the future location of a vehicle on a street network is one of the most
,challenging analyses used for improving context-aware location-based
,"services, intelligent transportation systems and criminology. In this"
,"research, the authors present a new short-term prediction algorithm and"
,explore the required analyses and web services. They present an
,appropriate method for chaining these web services to predict
,"location(s). To assess their methodology, they developed a prototype"
,system and tested for trajectories in Beijing. This system calculates
,the prediction time for a specified car to show the predicted future
,location in the street network. Their results showed that the average
,transferred data volume increases as the prediction period increases.
,The results also showed that the prediction algorithm has 75% accuracy
,at 1 min and 87.5% accuracy at 2 and 3 min. The implemented chaining
,method reduces the complexity of the location prediction algorithm for
,users because they do not need to know the processes. The outputs from
,this system can be used as input parameters for other web-based
,applications.

,"positioning devices embedded in mobile phones and cars, position"
,prediction of moving objects has been an important research direction
,for many location-based services such as public transit forecasting and
,"tourist behavior analysis. In this paper, a position prediction system"
,"has been proposed, which utilizes not only spatial but also temporal"
,regularity of object mobility. Historical trajectory data of the object
,is used to extract personal trajectory patterns to obtain candidate next
,positions. Each of the candidate next positions is scored by the
,proposed Spatio-Temporal Regularity-based Prediction (STRP) algorithm
,according to time components of patterns and current time. The position
,with the highest score is considered as the predicted next position.
,"Furthermore, a hybrid B/S and C/S architecture is employed to perform"
,the real-time prediction and results display. An evaluation based on two
,different public trajectory data sets demonstrates that the proposed
,"STRP algorithm achieves highly accurate position prediction. Moreover,"
,the average accuracy rate of our prediction algorithm with one known

AB,Moving destination prediction offers an important category of
,location-based applications and provides essential intelligence to
,"business and governments. In existing studies, a common approach to"
,destination prediction is to match the given query trajectory with
,"massive recorded trajectories by similarity calculation. Unfortunately,"
,"due to privacy concerns, budget constraints, and many other factors, in"
,"most circumstances, we can only obtain a sparse trajectory dataset. In"
,"sparse dataset, the available moving trajectories are far from enough to"
,cover all possible query trajectories; thus the predictability of the
,matching-based approach will decrease remarkably. Toward destination
,"prediction with sparse dataset, instead of searching similar"
,"trajectories over the sparse records, we alternatively examine the"
,changes of distances from sampling locations to final destination on
,query trajectory. The underlying idea is intuitive: It is directly
,"motivated by travel purpose, people always get closer to the final"
,destination during the movement. By borrowing the conception of gradient
,"descent in optimization theory, we propose a novel moving destination"

AB,Forecasting the future positions of mobile users is a valuable task
,allowing us to operate efficiently a myriad of different applications
,"which need this type of information. We propose MyWay, a prediction"
,system which exploits the individual systematic behaviors modeled by
,mobility profiles to predict human movements. MyWay provides three
,strategies: the individual strategy uses only the user individual
,"mobility profile, the collective strategy takes advantage of all users"
,"individual systematic behaviors, and the hybrid strategy that is a"
,combination of the previous two. A key point is that MyWay only requires
,"the sharing of individual mobility profiles, a concise representation of"
,"the user's movements, instead of raw trajectory data revealing the"
,detailed movement of the users. We evaluate the prediction performances
,of our proposal by a deep experimentation on large real-world data. The
,results highlight that the synergy between the individual and collective
,knowledge is the key for a better prediction and allow the system to
,outperform the state-of-art methods. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB,Moving route prediction offers important benefits for many emerging
,location-aware applications such as target advertising and urban traffic
,management. A common approach to route prediction is to match similar
,"trace recordings from a larger volume of historical trajectories, and"
,"return the targeted recorded path as desired answer. However, due to"
,"privacy concerns, incentive mechanism and other reasons, especially in"
,"small business environment, a limited dataset with sparse trajectories"
,"is only available. Actually, the existing sparse dataset cannot cover"
,"sufficient query routes, and then the match-based approach may return no"
,"results at all. Moreover, the existing sparse dataset may fail many"
,trajectory mining approaches that work well on general environment. In
,"this paper, we investigate moving route prediction from sparse"
,"trajectory dataset, and propose a novel hybrid model, namely HMRP, to"
,address the above problem. To avoid sparse distribution over spatial
,"semantic layer, a road network map reconstruction methods are proposed"
,to accommodate the sparse trajectories in semantic transformation. And
,"then, by training historical trajectories, the implicit mobility"
,patterns and Markov transition model are constructed to support route
,"prediction. When a query trajectory arrives, towards its derived"
,"potential destination, our proposed HMRP model integrates pattern"
,matching strategy and Markov probability distribution to predict its
,future route gradually in a complementary way. Experiments on real-life
,taxicab GPS recorded dataset demonstrate that HMRP method can improve
,"movement prediction precision significantly, comparing with the baseline"
,prediction algorithms. And the response time for each query trajectory
,is acceptable for most application cases.

AB,Destination prediction is very important in location-based services such
,as recommendation of targeted advertising location. Most current
,approaches always predict destination according to existing trip based
,"on history trajectories. However, no existing work has considered the"
,difference between the effects of passing-by locations and the
,"destination in history trajectories, which seriously impacts the"
,accuracy of predicted results as the destination can indicate the
,"purpose of traveling. Meanwhile, the temporal information of history"
,trajectories in destination prediction plays an important role. On one
,"hand, the history trajectories in different periods also differ in the"
,"influence, e.g., the history trajectories from last week can reflect the"
,status quo more accurately than the history trajectories two years ago.
,"On the other hand, the history trajectories in different time slots"
,"reflect different facts of traffic and moving habits of people, e.g.,"
,visiting a restaurant in the daytime and visiting a bar at night.
,Although a huge amount of history trajectories can be achieved in the
,"era of big data, it is still far from covering all the query"
,trajectories since a road network is widely distributed and trajectory
,data is sparse. The temporal sensitivity of history trajectories
,"highlights the sparsity problem even more. Therefore, we propose a novel"
,model T-DesP to solve the aforementioned problems. The model is
,comprised of two modules: trajectory learning and destination
,"prediction. In the module of trajectory learning, a novel method called"
,the mirror absorbing Markov chain model is proposed for modeling the
,trajectories for isolating the destination. We build a transition tensor
,to deduce the transition probability between each location pair in a
,"particular time slot. To address the data sparsity problem, we fill the"
,missing values in transition tensor through a context-aware tensor
,"decomposition approach. In the module of destination prediction, an"
,"absorbing tensor is derived from the filled transition tensor, and the"
,theoretical model is established for destination prediction. The

,performances depend highly on the ability to perceive mobiles within a

AB,Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging
,location-based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and
,targeted advertising according to destinations. A common approach to
,destination prediction is to derive the probability of a location being
,"the destination based on historical trajectories. However, almost all"
,the existing techniques use various kinds of extra information such as
,"road network, proprietary travel planner, statistics requested from"
,"government, and personal driving habits. Such extra information, in most"
,"circumstances, is unavailable or very costly to obtain. Thereby we"
,approach the task of destination prediction by using only historical
,"trajectory dataset. However, this approach encounters the ""data sparsity"
,"problem"", i.e., the available historical trajectories are far from"
,"enough to cover all possible query trajectories, which considerably"
,limits the number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted
,destinations. We propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis
,(SubSyn) to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn first decomposes
,historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two adjacent
,"locations, and then connects the sub-trajectories into ""synthesised"""
,trajectories. This process effectively expands the historical trajectory
,dataset to contain much more trajectories. Experiments based on real
,datasets show that SubSyn can predict destinations for up to ten times
,more query trajectories than a baseline prediction algorithm.
,"Furthermore, the running time of the SubSyn-training algorithm is almost"
,"negligible for a large set of 1.9 million trajectories, and the"
,SubSyn-prediction algorithm runs over two orders of magnitude faster
,than the baseline prediction algorithm constantly.

AB,This paper proposes a system architecture and case study for a
,heterogeneous moving-object trajectory metamodel using generic sensors.
,In order to provide a unified metamodel and powerful framework for
,"trajectory's services and queries, the proposed trajectory's data model"
,has benefited from advantages of both conceptual and ontological
,"space-time. However, it extends the basic data model of trajectory with"
,new patterns as the space-time path to describe activities of the moving
,"object and the composite region of interest. Additionally, the proposed"
,system is distinguished by providing a framework for dealing with
,"moving-object trajectory in an interoperable way, using heterogonous"
,sensors that traditional data model incapable for this purpose. The
,proposed system architecture for the moving-object trajectory's data
,model is focused on service composability and data interoperability
,"combining Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, Service-Oriented"
,"Architecture, and streaming technology, to allow applications built"
,using the framework to be scalable and have better performance. The case
,study presented for tracking travelers at the airport means that
,passenger locations can be determined with a higher degree of accuracy
,"and precision. Indeed, this system makes it easy to answer complex"
,"queries, such as seeing closely where passengers congregate, how much"
,"time they spend in stores and restaurants, and where there may be"
,bottlenecks. It will also enable airport retailers to communicate with
,travelers directly.

AB,Personalized route prediction is an important technology in many
,applications related to intelligent vehicles and transportation systems.
,Current route prediction technologies used in many general navigation
,"systems are, by and large, based on either the shortest or the fastest"
,route selection. Personal traveling route prediction is a very
,"challenging big data problem, as trips getting longer and variations in"
,routes growing. It is particularly challenging for real-time in-vehicle
,"applications, since many embedded processors have limited memory and"
,computational power. In this paper we present a machine learning
,"algorithm for modeling route prediction based on a Markov chain model,"
,and a route prediction algorithm based on a probability transition
,"matrix. We also present two data reduction algorithms, one is developed"
,to map large GPS based trips to a compact link-based standard route
,"representation, and another a machine learning algorithm to"
,significantly reduce the size of a probability transition matrix. The
,proposed algorithms are evaluated on real-world driving trip data
,"collected in four months, where the data collected in the first three"
,months are used as training and the data in the fourth month are used as
,testing. Our experiment results show that the proposed personal route
,prediction system generated more than 91% prediction accuracy in average
,among the test trips. The data reduction algorithm gave about 8:1
,reduction in link-based standard route representation and 23: 1 in
,reducing the size of probability transition matrix.

AB,"With increasingly prevalent mobile positioning devices, such as GPS"
,"loggers, smart phones, and GPS navigation devices, a huge amount of"
,trajectories data is collected. Users are able to obtain the various
,"location-based services by uploading their trajectories. In this paper,"
,we address that a user's movement behavior is able to discover by their
,similar shape trajectories and resulted in some regions frequently stay
,"in common, called relevant stay regions. Once a set of stay regions"
,"discovered, we can predict the next region where the user intends to go"
,"and provide location-based information of the next stay in advance, such"
,"as traffic status, targeted advertises, sightseeing recommendations, and"
,so on. Prior works have elaborated on discovering stay region from the
,whole crowd trajectories and then exploring the relations between the
,regions to describe the movement patterns for location prediction.
,"However, the trajectories pass the same region may not have the similar"
,"movement behavior. Thus, we propose a framework to discover stay regions"
,relevant to the specific movement behavior and then applied in location
,"prediction, called Region Modeling and Mobility Prediction. The proposed"
,framework includes two modules: region modeling and mobility prediction.
,"In the region modeling module, we develop shape clustering method to"
,group the similar trajectories from historical data and then explore the
,stay region model from trajectory clusters. Based on the discovered
,"region model, the mobility prediction module provide a cluster selection"
,algorithm and several prediction strategies to generate the top-k

,"user on the move. After observing the movement from a starting point, we"
,are able to create possible extrapolations of routes. Our basic
,"assumption: a mobile user tries to move efficiently, thus only a certain"

,"information about movement costs to detect reasonable movements, but we"
,do not expect theoretical optimal paths. We are able to model different
,efficiency goals and different degrees of optimality. We present an

AB,As there is great differences of movement patterns and social
,"correlation between weekdays and weekends, we propose a fallback"
,social-temporal-hierarchic Markov model (FSTHM) to predict individual's

,decompose the original state of traditional Markov model into two
,different states and distinguish the difference of the strength of
,"social ties on weekdays and weekends. Except for the time division, the"
,distribution of the visit time for each state is also considered to

AB,Mobile user similarity is significant for location-based social network
,"services. With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies,"
,research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories
,"has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only"
,"short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity"
,"similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the"
,problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their

,"the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture"
,users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user
,"are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user"
,similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine
,"activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and"
,artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with
,different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity

AB,A route trajectory is described as the upcoming course of the road in
,geographical terms as well as in terms of time. This enables the
,possibility of providing context-aware applications in modern vehicles.
,In order to generate such a trajectory with its context aware
,"information, it is still necessary to enter a destination point into a"
,"navigation system. However, the most frequent commutations (drives,"
,trips) are to known destinations and are therefore not performed with
,any active guidance system. This means that the prediction must be
,"determined in a different manner. This paper presents a method, which"
,predicts the route trajectory of a vehicle based on the travel history
,of its user. In addition to the traveled distance further context
,parameters are used for the prediction. These parameters include the
,"current time of day, day of week and the route frequency, which"
,indicates the number of times a particular route has already been
,"traveled. Moreover, the developed prediction is evaluated in a"
,volunteers study with about 500 rides and about 9.500 driven kilometers.
,The results show that in 80 percent of the cases the forward-lying path
,can be predicted correctly.

AB,Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging location
,based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and targeted
,advertising based on destination. A common approach to destination
,prediction is to derive the probability of a location being the
,"destination based on historical trajectories. However, existing"
,"techniques using this approach suffer from the ""data sparsity problem"","
,"i.e., the available historical trajectories is far from being able to"
,coverall possible trajectories. This problem considerably limits the
,number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted destinations. We
,propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis(SubSyn) algorithm
,to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn algorithm first decomposes
,historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two
,"neighbouring locations,and then connects the sub-trajectories into"
,"""synthesised"" trajectories. The number of query trajectories that can"
,have predicted destinations is exponentially increased by this means.
,Experiments based on real datasets show that SubSyn algorithm can
,predict destinations for upto ten times more query trajectories than a
,baseline algorithm while the SubSyn prediction algorithm runs over two
,"orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. In this paper,we"
,also consider the privacy protection issue in case an adversary uses
,SubSyn algorithm to derive sensitive location information of users. We
,propose an efficient algorithm to select a minimum number of locations a
,user has to hide on her trajectory in order to avoid privacy leak.
,Experiments also validate the high efficiency of the privacy protection
,algorithm.

,"facilitate users in many application scenarios, but they raise concerns"
,on the breach of privacy related to location access. Smartphone users
,"can hardly perceive location access, especially when it happens in"
,"background. In comparison to location access in foreground, location"
,access in background could result in more serious privacy breach because
,"it can continuously know a user's locations. In this paper, we study the"
,"problem of location access in background, and especially perform the"
,first measurement of this background action on the Google app market.
,Our investigation demonstrates that many popular apps conduct location
,access in background within short intervals. This enables these apps to
,"collect a user's location trace, from which the important personal"
,"information, Points of Interest (Pots), can be recognized. We further"
,"extract a user's movement pattern from the Pots, and utilize it to"
,measure the extent of privacy breach. The measurement results also show
,that using the combination of movement pattern related metrics and the
,other PoI related metrics can help detect the privacy breach in an

AB,Analysing and mining trajectories pose new challenges for trajectory
,privacy. We are addressing privacy issue for offline (historical)
,trajectories which are generally published for research. A fundamental
,research question in trajectory privacy domain is of trajectory
,anonymisation. k-anonymity is used as a standard for privacy which
,ensures that every entity in the dataset is indistinguishable from (k -
,1) other entities. The proposed work aims at anonymising trajectories
,based on graph split method. We have used technique of constructing
,trajectory graph to simulate spatial and temporal relations of
,"trajectories, based on which trajectory k-anonymity sets are found"
,"through graph split. For the purpose, we have proposed a novel method"
,that uses earth mover's distance as a metric to find trajectory
,k-anonymity sets in contrast to Euclidean distance. It is discovered
,through a series of experiments that the proposed method is
,outperforming in terms of low information loss and computation time.

,Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) influence

AB,The pervasiveness of location-acquisition and mobile computing
,"techniques has generated massive spatial trajectory data, which has"
,brought great challenges to the management and analysis of such a big
,"data. In this paper, we focus on the sub-trajectory dataset profiling"
,"problem, and aim to extract the representative sub-trajectories from the"
,"raw trajectory as a subset, called profile, which can best describe the"
,whole dataset. This problem is very challenging subject to finding the
,most representative sub-trajectories set by trading off the size and
,"quality of the profile. To tackle this problem, we model the features of"
,"the trajectory dataset from the aspects of density, speed and the"
,direction flow. Meanwhile we present our two-step method to select the
,"representative trajectories based on the feature model. First, a novel"
,trajectory segmentation algorithm is applied on a raw trajectory to
,identify the representative segments concerning their feature
,representativeness and automatically estimate the number of segments and
,"the segment borders. Then, a sub-trajectory profiling method is"
,performed to yield the most representative sub-trajectories in the
,"dataset, based on a local heuristic evolution strategy. We evaluate our"
,method based on extensive experiments by using two real-world trajectory
,"datasets generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing and Shanghai. The"
,results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods in
,different applications.

AB,"The wide adoption of location-enabled devices, together with the"
,"acceptance of services that leverage (personal) data as payment, allows"
,scientists to push through some of the previous barriers imposed by data
,"insufficiency, ethics and privacy skepticism. The research problems"
,whose study require hard-to-obtain data (e.g. transportation mode
,"detection, service contextualisation, etc.) have now become more"
,accessible to scientists because of the availability of data collecting
,outlets. One such problem is the detection of a user's transportation
,mode. Different fields have approached the problem of transportation
,mode detection with different aims: Location-Based Services (LBS) is a
,field that focuses on understanding the transportation mode in
,"real-time, Transportation Science is a field that focuses on measuring"
,"the daily travel patterns of individuals or groups of individuals, and"
,Human Geography is a field that focuses on enriching a trajectory by
,adding domain-specific semantics. While different fields providing
,"solutions to the same problem could be viewed as a positive outcome, it"
,is difficult to compare these solutions because the reported performance
,indicators depend on the type of approach and its aim (e.g. the
,real-time availability of LBS requires the performance to be computed on
,each classified location). The contributions of this paper are three
,"fold. First, the paper reviews the critical aspects desired by each"
,research field when providing solutions to the transportation mode

,"three branches of science based on their main interest. Finally, it"
,"identifies important gaps in research and future directions, that is,"

AB,Viruses are the intracellular pathogens that reproduce only in the
,living cell and manipulate the cellular machinery to produce more
,viruses. Viral replications can affect cellular genes of the host in
,"multiple cancerous ways. Approximately, 20% of all human oncogenesis is"
,caused by cancer-causing viruses known as oncoviruses. Viral infection
,"causes chronic inflammation leading to cell death, uncontrollable"
,"proliferation, and modulated expression of some of the regulatory"
,proteins. Oncogenesis is a multistep phenomenon in which normal host
,cells are transformed into cancerous cells on the basis of host genetic
,variability. Oncogenic viruses encode genes that cause viral replication
,and transformation of the host cells to produce viral proteins and
,protein complexes. The phenomenon from basic viral infection to
,tumorigenesis is lengthy due to the involvement of factors like immunity
,"complications, cellular mutations, and exposure to other cancerous"
,agents. The viruses that are involved in human cancer development are
,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus"

AB,Transport mode information is essential for understanding people's
,movement behavior and travel demand estimation. Current approaches
,extract travel information once the travel is complete. Such approaches
,are limited in terms of generating just-in-time information for a number
,"of mobility based applications, e.g., real time mode specific patronage"
,estimation. In order to detect the transport modalities from GPS
,"trajectories, various machine learning approaches have already been"
,"explored. However, the majority of them produce only a single conclusion"
,"from a given set of evidences, ignoring the uncertainty of any mode"
,"classification. Also, the existing machine learning approaches fall"
,"short in explaining their reasoning scheme. In contrast, a fuzzy expert"
,system can explain its reasoning scheme in a human readable format along
,"with a provision of inferring different outcome possibilities, but lacks"
,"the adaptivity and learning ability of machine learning. In this paper,"
,a novel hybrid knowledge driven framework is developed by integrating a
,fuzzy logic and a neural network to complement each other's limitations.
,Thus the aim of this paper is to automate the tuning process in order to
,generate an intelligent hybrid model that can perform effectively in
,near-real time mode detection using GPS trajectory. Tests demonstrate
,that a hybrid knowledge driven model works better than a purely
,knowledge driven model and at per the machine learning models in the
,context of transport mode detection.

AB,Traditional travel survey methods have been widely used for collecting
,information about urban mobility although Global Position System (GPS)
,has become an automatic option for collecting more precise data of the
,households since mid-1990s. Many studies on mobility patterns have
,focused on the GPS advantages leaving aside its issues such as the
,"quality of the data collected. However, when it comes to extract the"
,"frequency of the trips and travelled distance, this technology faces"
,some gaps due to the related issues such as signal reception and
,time-to-first-fix location that turns out in missing observations and
,"respectively unrecognised or over-segmented trips. In this study, we"
,"focus on two aspects of GPS data for a car-mode, (i) measurement of the"
,gaps in the travelled distance and (ii) estimation of the travelled
,"distance and the factors that influence the GPS gaps. To asses that, GPS"
,"tracks are compared to a ground truth source. Additionally, the trips"
,are analysed based on the land use (e.g. urban and rural areas) and
,"length (e.g. short, medium and long trips). Results from 170"
,participants and more than a year of GPS-tracking show that around 9 %
,of the travelled distance is not captured by GPS and it affects more
,"short trips than long ones. Moreover, we validate the importance of the"
,time spent on the user activity and the land use as factors that
,influence the gaps in GPS.

AB,Genomic instability and epigenetic alterations are distinct hallmarks
,shared by cancer and aging. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are class III histone
,deacetylases that regulate gene expression in response to cellular
,metabolic status. SIRTs can modulate chromatin function through direct
,deacetylation of histones and by promoting altered methylation of
,"histones and DNA, leading to repression of transcription. They can also"
,interact and deacetylate a broad range of transcription factors and
,"coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression both positively"
,and negatively. SIRT inhibition may be beneficial in decreasing the risk
,"of some cancers, while SIRT activation can exert positive antiaging"
,"effects and help prevent age-related disease and cancers. Thus, SIRT"
,modulation may positively affect the treatment of cancer and age-related
,"disorders. In this study, we review emerging data on the effects of"
,SIRTs as important regulators of genomic stability and explain the

AB,Human mobility is important for understanding the evolution of size and
,"structure of urban areas, the spatial distribution of facilities, and"
,"the provision of transportation services. Until recently, exploring"
,human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods
,"consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or"
,interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly
,altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human
,movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in
,"identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate"
,solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental
,context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt
,to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of
,human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and
,contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the
,identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places)
,"behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and"
,spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how
,"travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the"
,"tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which"
,are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend
,time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We
,evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205
,volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of
,places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this
,study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new
,possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.

AB,Global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning
,System (GPS) is one of the most important sensors for movement analysis.
,"GPS is widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and"
,"human beings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both"
,measurement and interpolation errors. In this article we show that
,measurement error causes a systematic bias in distances recorded with a
,GPS; the distance between two points recorded with a GPS is - on average
,- bigger than the true distance between these points. This systematic
,overestimation of distance' becomes relevant if the influence of
,"interpolation error can be neglected, which in practice is the case for"
,movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical
,explanation of this phenomenon and illustrate that it functionally
,depends on the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error (C). We argue
,that C can be interpreted as a quality measure for movement data
,recorded with a GPS. If there is a strong autocorrelation between any
,"two consecutive position estimates, they have very similar error. This"
,"error cancels out when average speed, distance or direction is"
,calculated along the trajectory. Based on our theoretical findings we
,introduce a novel approach to determine C in real-world GPS movement
,data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our approach to pedestrian
,trajectories and car trajectories. We found that the measurement error
,in the data was strongly spatially and temporally autocorrelated and
,"give a quality estimate of the data. Most importantly, our findings are"
,not limited to GPS alone. The systematic bias and its implications are
,bound to occur in any movement data collected with absolute positioning
,if interpolation error can be neglected.

AB,Floating car data (FCD) recorded with the Global Positioning System
,"(GPS) are an important data source for traffic research. However, FCD"
,"are subject to error, which can relate either to the accuracy of the"
,recordings (measurement error) or to the temporal rate at which the data
,are sampled (interpolation error). Both errors affect movement
,"parameters derived from the FCD, such as speed or direction, and"
,consequently influence conclusions drawn about the movement. In this
,paper we combined recent findings about the autocorrelation of GPS
,measurement error and well-established findings from random walk theory
,"to analyse a set of real-world FCD. First, we showed that the"
,measurement error in the FCD was affected by positive autocorrelation.
,"We explained why this is a quality measure of the data. Second, we"
,evaluated four metrics to assess the influence of interpolation error.
,We found that interpolation error strongly affects the correct
,"interpretation of the car's dynamics (speed, direction), whereas its"
,"impact on the path (travelled distance, spatial location) was moderate."
,Based on these results we gave recommendations for recording of FCD
,"using the GPS. Our recommendations only concern time-based sampling,"
,"change-based, location-based or event-based sampling are not discussed."
,The sampling approach minimizes the effects of error on movement
,parameters while avoiding the collection of redundant information. This
,is crucial for obtaining reliable results from FCD.

AB,Rooted in the philosophy of point-and segment-based approaches for
,"transportation mode segmentation of trajectories, the measures that"

,"incomparable across approaches, hence slowing the progress in the field"
,and (2) do not provide insight about the quality of the continuous
,"transportation mode segmentation. To address these problems, this paper"
,proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a
,continuous transportation mode segmentation model performs. The error
,measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous
,"intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the"
,alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the
,corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing
,errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic
,"transportation mode segmentation approaches (implicit,"
,"explicit-holistic, and explicit-consensus-based transport mode"
,"segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture."
,Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the
,"superiority of explicit-consensus-based transport mode segmentation,"
,which can be attributed to the explicit modeling of segments and
,"transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex"
,learning task.

AB,"Road congestion has been one of the major issues in most metropolises,"
,"and thus, it is crucial to detect road congestions effectively and"
,efficiently. Traditional solutions require the deployment of dedicated
,"sensors on the roadside or on the vehicles, which suffer from high"
,"installation and maintenance costs and limited coverage. In this paper,"
,we propose an alternative solution by exploiting the sensing ability of
,"mobile phones. However, it is challenging to detect road congestions in"
,a daily-living environment using undedicated mobile phones while
,guaranteeing energy efficiency. The proposed system only depends on the
,"accelerometer and cellular signal, which have been proven to be energy"
,"efficient as compared with other built-in sensors (e.g., GPS). It"
,consists of three interactive modules: (a) an accelerometer-based
,vehicular movement detection module for detecting the periods when the
,mobile phone user is traveling by vehicle; (b) a map-matching module
,relying on the cellular signal for determining the traveled road
,segments; and (c) a road congestion estimation module for inferring the
,congestion degree of the traveled road segments. We evaluated the
,"proposed system based on real-world datasets, with promising results."

AB,"Over the past couple of decades, there has been an exponential increase"
,in the collection of large-scale GPS data from household/personal travel
,"surveys all over the world. A range of algorithms, which vary from"
,"specific rules to advanced machine learning methods, have been applied"
,to extract travel modes from raw GPS data collected by smartphone-based
,"travel surveys. However, most of the methods applied neither describe"
,the interaction between features influencing the travel mode decision
,nor effectively deal with the ambiguity inherently incorporated in these
,"features. This paper identifies travel modes with a Bayesian network,"
,whose structure is established based on a K2 algorithm and corresponding
,conditional probability tables are estimated with maximum likelihood
,"methods. Five representative travel modes walk, bike, e-bike, bus and"
,car are distinguished using the resulting Bayesian network.
,"Additionally, the low speed rate and the average heading change are"
,introduced to reduce uncertainties between bike and e-bike segments and
,between bus and car segments. The derived travel modes are then compared
,with those retrieved in the prompted recall survey by telephones.
,"Consequently, more than 86% of segments have the travel mode correctly"
,"identified for each travel mode, with over 97% of walk segments being"
,properly flagged. Results from the study demonstrate that GPS travel
,surveys provide an opportunity to supplement traditional travel surveys.

AB,"In the taxicab industry, a long-standing challenge is how to reduce"
,"taxicabs' miles spent without fares, i.e., cruising miles. The current"
,solutions for this challenge usually depend on passengers to actively
,provide their locations in advance for pickups. To address this
,"challenge without the burden on passengers, in this paper, we propose a"
,"cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to find efficient routes"
,to pick up passengers to reduce cruising miles. According to the
,"real-time pick-up events from nearby taxicabs, pCruise characterizes a"
,"cruising process with a cruising graph, and assigns weights on edges of"
,the cruising graph to indicate the utility of cruising corresponding
,road segments. Our weighting process considers the number of nearby
,"passengers and taxicabs together in real-time, aiming at two scenarios"
,where taxicabs are explicitly or implicitly coordinated with each other.
,"Based on a weighted cruising graph, when a taxicab becomes vacant,"
,pCruise provides a distributed online scheduling strategy to obtain and
,update an efficient cruising route with the minimum length and at least
,one arriving passenger. We evaluate pCruise based on a real-world GPS
,"dataset from a Chinese city Shenzhen with 14,000 taxicabs. The"

,cruising miles by 42 percent on average.

,"number of methods, which range from rule-based to advanced"
,"classification approaches, have been applied to detect travel modes from"
,GPS positioning data collected in travel surveys based on GPS-enabled
,"smartphones or dedicated GPS devices. Among these approaches, neural"
,networks (NNs) are widely adopted because they can extract subtle

,is introduced to train the NNs. The resulting PSO-NNs are employed to
,"distinguish among four travel modes (walk, bike, bus, and car) with GPS"
,positioning data collected through a smartphone-based travel survey. As
,"a result, 95.81% of samples are correctly flagged for the training set,"
,while 94.44% are correctly identified for the test set. Results from

,"differences across countries, it detects the discriminative activities"
,according to the related traffic patterns in different countries. By

AB,"In real world scenarios, people's movement include several environments"
,"rather than one, for example, road network, pavement areas and indoor."
,This imposes a new challenge for moving objects database that the

,novel queries regarding different transportation modes should also be
,supported. Since existing methods are limited to trips in a single

,that aims to evaluate the performance of a database system managing
,moving objects in different environments. GMOBench is settled in a
,realistic scenario and is comprised of three components: (1) a data
,generator with the capability of creating a scalable set of trips
,representing the complete movement of humans (both indoor and outdoor);
,"(2) a set of carefully designed and benchmark queries; (3) Mode-RTree,"
,an index structure for managing generic moving objects. The generator

,results. We create the benchmark data in such a way that the dataset can
,mirror important characteristics and real world distributions of human
,mobility. Efficient access methods and optimization techniques are

,queries is greatly reduced. GMOBench is implemented in a real database
,system to have a practical result. We perform an extensive experimental

,"present Friendbook, a novel semantic-based friend recommendation system"
,"for social networks, which recommends friends to users based on their"
,life styles instead of social graphs. By taking advantage of sensor-rich

,recommends friends to users if their life styles have high similarity.
,"Inspired by text mining, we model a user's daily life as life documents,"
,from which his/her life styles are extracted by using the Latent
,Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. We further propose a similarity metric
,"to measure the similarity of life styles between users, and calculate"
,users' impact in terms of life styles with a friend-matching graph. Upon
,"receiving a request, Friendbook returns a list of people with highest"

,a feedback mechanism to further improve the recommendation accuracy. We

AB,The ubiquitous presence of sensor-rich smartphones offers excellent
,opportunities to capture and monitor individuals' contexts and
,activities such as the utilized modes of transport. Most of the current
,systems inferring transportation modes involve continuous sensing of GPS
,"or acceleration modules, which inconveniently decreases the battery"
,lifetime. This paper presents a more battery-efficient approach for
,transportation mode detection. This approach introduces an additional
,component able to detect whether a user is using any transportation mean
,"or none at all, based on cellular network information only. Using this a"
,"priori knowledge, our inference model is able to avoid the"
,battery-exhausting transportation mode detection when users are not
,travelling. Based on experiments involving six participants we show that
,"our approach allows the transportation modes car, train and walk to be"
,distinguished with an accuracy of 95.7%. Tests on a dataset collected by
,nine participants show that the a priori knowledge can be obtained with
,an accuracy of 85%. Further experiments reveal that our approach is able
,"to gain 75% of battery lifetime. Finally, we outline an implementation"
,of our detection approach providing flexible means to configure the use
,of smartphone sensors and thus supporting the kind of experiments
,presented in this paper.

AB,"Heart isolation (separating the heart from the neighboring tissues,"
,"e.g., lung, liver, and rib cage) is a prerequisite to generate a 3D"
,volume visualization as an intuitive view for coronary disease diagnosis
,"and treatment planning. Previously, we proposed a component-carving"
,based heart isolation approach by removing unwanted background tissues
,"(e.g., non-cardiac structures, left atrial appendage, and pulmonary"
,"veins/arteries) sequentially. However, the final mask usually has many"
,small extra pieces due to the difficulty to model and segment all
,"background tissues. In this paper, we propose a component-composition"
,"based approach, which starts from an empty mask and then adds in wanted"
,"components (coronary arteries, four chambers, and the aorta) segmented"
,from the original image. The proposed method can generate a much cleaner
,mask than the component-carving approach since only the wanted
,structures are added and the segmentation of the heart chambers and the
,aorta is more robust and accurate due to their greater predictability.

AB,Pervasive computing and social computing are two major computing
,"paradigms of this decade, which have evolved more or less in isolation"
,from each other. Integrating pervasive systems with social media can
,enhance the users' experience and enable them to form pervasive
,"communities with others that share similar interests, habits, profile,"
,"behaviour, to communicate and interact with them, to socialise and to"
,share their resources in a seamless manner. But to be able to couple the
,"advantages of pervasive computing and social networking, the wealth of"
,"user context information available needs to be properly processed,"
,managed and exploited. This imposes several critical requirements
,regarding reliable context learning and reasoning facilities. This paper
,presents a multi-user context inference mechanism that is based on
,Neural Networks and aims to exploit the knowledge available at community
,level. This mechanism has been evaluated via various experiments and is
,"proven to perform quite well, even in cases of community members, about"
,whom only limited volumes of historical context data are available.

,as input and tries to identify anomalies for users following normal
,routes such as taking public transportation from the workplace to home
,or vice versa. Trajectories are modeled as a discrete-time series of
,"axis-parallel constraints (""boxes"") in the 2-D space. The anomaly can be"
,"estimated by considering two trajectories, where one trajectory is the"
,current movement pattern and the other is a weighted trajectory
,collected from N norms. The proposed system was implemented and
,evaluated with eight individuals with cognitive impairments. The
,experimental results showed that recall was 95.0% and precision was
,90.9% on average without false alarm suppression. False alarms and false
,negatives dropped when axis rotation was applied. The precision with
,axis rotation was 97.6% and the recall was 98.8%. The average time used
,"for sending locations, running anomaly detection, and issuing warnings"
,was in the range of 15.1-22.7 s. Our findings suggest that the ability
,to adapt anomaly detection devices for appropriate timing of self-alerts
,will be particularly important.

,during a period of time can be useful to learn and estimate both the
,traffic and the driver's intent at specific moment of time. With our
,solution we want to go a step further to the existing GPS navigation
,systems by designing a mechanism that is capable to learn driver's
,routes. We could offer in the future a point-to-point concept for an
,environmentally friendly routing mechanism anywhere within a selected
,road network based on our HMM-method and a training process. Our study
,is based on real data collected from various local drivers and can be
,easily applied in modern intelligent traffic systems. The system comes
,with a user interface that displays the GPS routes on the map for a
,specific driver. These routes can be analyzed using parameters like
,"time, distance, height and speed. Also we developed a tool that manages"

AB,The purpose of received signal strength (RSS) correction in radio-map
,based Wi-Fi localization is to obtain a set of fine-grain
,"location-dependent RSS fingerprints, and eventually achieve the purpose"
,"of highly accurate and reliable localization. To meet this goal, the RSS"
,correction is conducted on the raw RSS samples to eliminate the
,environmental noise from the radio-map. This paper shows the
,comprehensive analysis on the autocorrelation property of the
,"chronological RSS samples in the same RSS sequence, and meanwhile"
,"presents the correlated RSS correction approach. Furthermore, the"
,correlated RSS correction approach can also be integrated into the
,conventional radio-map based K nearest neighbor (KNN) and weighted KNN
,(WKNN) localization algorithms. The experimental results conducted on
,the real Wi-Fi RSS samples recorded in a representative indoor
,environment prove that the proposed correlated RSS correction approach
,can result in the significant improvement of accuracy over the
,conventional radio-map based localization.

,introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity
,recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example
,problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors
,attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of
,this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition
,problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how

,review what they have learned regarding their learning habits. What's
,"more, by monitoring learners' reaction on the recommendation or"

,"implementing human activity recognition on mobile devices. In this area,"
,the mobile app is usually always on and the general challenge is how to
,"balance accuracy and energy consumption. However, among existing"
,"approaches, those based on cellular IDs consume little power but are"
,less accurate; those based on GPS/Wi-Fi sampling are accurate often at
,"the costs of battery drainage; moreover, previous methods in general do"

,"consists of two modes: In the deliberation mode, the system learns cell"
,ID patterns that are trained by existing GPS-/Wi-Fi-based methods; in
,"the intuition mode, only the learned cell ID patterns are used for"
,"activity recognition, which is both accurate and energy efficient;"
,system parameters are learned to control the transition from
,"deliberation to intuition, when sufficient confidence is gained, and the"
,"transition from intuition to deliberation, when more training is needed."
,"For the scope of this paper, we first elaborate our framework in a"

,and compares the performance of a novel kernel-based algorithm with a
,more traditional time-distance cluster detection method.
,Methods: A set of 750 artificial GPS tracks containing three stops each
,"were generated, with various levels of noise.. A total of 9,000 tracks"
,were processed to measure the algorithms' capacity to detect stop
,"locations and estimate stop durations, with varying GPS noise and"
,algorithm parameters.
,Results: The proposed kernel-based algorithm outperformed the
,traditional algorithm on most criteria associated to activity place
,"detection, and offered a stronger resilience to GPS noise, managing to"
,"detect up to 92.3% of actual stops, and estimating stop duration within"
,5% error margins at all tested noise levels.
,Conclusions: Capacity to detect activity locations is an important
,feature in a context of increasing use of GPS devices in health and
,place research. While further testing with real-life tracks is
,"recommended, testing algorithms' performance with artificial track sets"
,for which characteristics are controlled is useful. The proposed novel
,algorithm outperformed the traditional algorithm under these conditions.

AB,The mobile end user context has received a lot of attention from the
,mobile services industry lately. The location-based and
,context-sensitive information that are characteristic for smartphones
,can be utilized to study the use context of mobile end users.
,"Accordingly, this article utilizes handset-based data in analyzing how"
,the context of use affects the usage of smartphone communication
,services. The context is identified with an algorithm utilizing mobile
,network cell ID and WLAN data and resulting in five place-related
,"contexts, namely Home, Office, Other meaningful, Elsewhere and Abroad."
,"According to our analysis, voice calls are used least intensively in the"
,"Home context where the length of the voice calls is the longest,"
,"however. Email and SMS are used most intensively in the Office context,"
,"where the voice calls are the shortest in duration. Finally, mobile"
,IM/VoIP and social media services are more free-time oriented as they
,are used most intensively in Elsewhere and Other meaningful contexts.
,The findings imply that people use smartphone communication services
,"differently depending on the use context. However, context can be"
,"defined and identified in a number of ways, and this article presents"
,only one solution that is highly dependent on the type of data
,collected.

AB,The concepts of location and community are rapidly becoming key points
,in the design of new communication paradigms and in deploying emerging
,mobile computing services. The need of reliable and quantitative
,"knowledge and predictions of some relevant information, such as which"
,locations are enjoyed by people in their daily lives and how people
,"aggregate within communities, advocates a realistic mobility model able"
,to describe both the human mobility throughout locations and the human
,"attitude to socialize within communities. Unfortunately, so far, neither"
,the concept of location nor the concept of community has been univocally
,"defined. In this paper, we approach the problem from the most basic of"
,"starting points, namely by analyzing the real Global Positioning System"
,"datasets of human mobility traces. On this elementary basis, the paper"
,provides a few relevant contributions. We firstly derive a deep
,understanding of the term location and at the same time of the notion of
,"community strictly related to it. Secondly, we merge the two concepts"
,into what we call geo-community. By proceeding from real spatial data
,"rather than from a priori reasonings, we are able to quantitatively"
,describe geo-communities and infer the probability distributions of all
,"the features of human behavior. Finally, not to lose social"
,"implications, we present the method to derive people sociality from"

AB,A route trajectory is described as the upcoming course of the road in
,geographical terms as well as in terms of time. This enables the
,possibility of providing context-aware applications in modern vehicles.
,In order to generate such a trajectory with its context aware
,"information, it is still necessary to enter a destination point into a"
,"navigation system. However, the most frequent commutations (drives,"
,trips) are to known destinations and are therefore not performed with
,any active guidance system. This means that the prediction must be
,"determined in a different manner. This paper presents a method, which"
,predicts the route trajectory of a vehicle based on the travel history
,of its user. In addition to the traveled distance further context
,parameters are used for the prediction. These parameters include the
,"current time of day, day of week and the route frequency, which"
,indicates the number of times a particular route has already been
,"traveled. Moreover, the developed prediction is evaluated in a"
,volunteers study with about 500 rides and about 9.500 driven kilometers.
,The results show that in 80 percent of the cases the forward-lying path
,can be predicted correctly.

AB,GPS-based activity recognition is extremely important for high-level
,analysis and location based services. Trajectories of people are highly
,imbalanced from spatial and temporal perspectives. Many existing
,researches achieve good results on recognizing activities with lots of
,"GPS logs, such as working and staying at home. However, these approaches"
,"usually fail at activities with few trajectory records. In this paper,"
,we propose a cost sensitive GPS-based activity recognition model to
,improve accuracy of minority activities which could imply users'
,personal preferences. The approach aims at providing more balanced
,results. We first propose a cost function to measure spatial and
,temporal regularities of each activity on a stay point. Then we
,incorporate cost function into activity recognition algorithm. We take
,hidden Markov model as an example in this study. Experiments show good
,performance of our approach in several evaluation metrics. It could
,provide more balanced and valuable activity recognition results from GPS
,trajectories.

AB,Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging location
,based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and targeted
,advertising based on destination. A common approach to destination
,prediction is to derive the probability of a location being the
,"destination based on historical trajectories. However, existing"
,"techniques using this approach suffer from the ""data sparsity problem"","
,"i.e., the available historical trajectories is far from being able to"
,coverall possible trajectories. This problem considerably limits the
,number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted destinations. We
,propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis(SubSyn) algorithm
,to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn algorithm first decomposes
,historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two
,"neighbouring locations,and then connects the sub-trajectories into"
,"""synthesised"" trajectories. The number of query trajectories that can"
,have predicted destinations is exponentially increased by this means.
,Experiments based on real datasets show that SubSyn algorithm can
,predict destinations for upto ten times more query trajectories than a
,baseline algorithm while the SubSyn prediction algorithm runs over two
,"orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. In this paper,we"
,also consider the privacy protection issue in case an adversary uses
,SubSyn algorithm to derive sensitive location information of users. We
,propose an efficient algorithm to select a minimum number of locations a
,user has to hide on her trajectory in order to avoid privacy leak.
,Experiments also validate the high efficiency of the privacy protection
,algorithm.

AB,Continuous personal position information has been attracting attention

,studies have applied the telecommunication histories of mobile phones
,(CDRs: call detail records) to position acquisition. Although
,large-scale and long-term data are accumulated from CDRs through
,"everyday use of mobile phones, the spatial resolution of CDRs is lower"
,"than that of existing positioning technologies. Therefore, interpolating"
,spatiotemporal positions of such sparse CDRs in accordance with human

,we propose a new method to compensate for CDR drawbacks in tracking
,positions. We generate as many candidate routes as possible in the
,spatiotemporal domain using trip patterns interpolated using road and
,railway networks and select the most likely route from them. Trip
,patterns are feasible combinations between stay places that are detected
,from individual location histories in CDRs. The most likely route could
,be estimated through comparing candidate routes to observed CDRs during
,a target day. We also show the assessment of our method using CDRs and
,GPS logs obtained in the experimental survey.

AB,"By leveraging online social networks as an underlying infrastructure,"
,Social Participatory Network (SPN) has been becoming a new paradigm of
,"participatory sensing systems. However, a significant barrier to the"

,forms of malicious attacks. Such threats inhibit human participation and
,thus the viability of SPN systems in everyday use. To solve this

,"is based on the Tianjin University's own existing SPN system, named CRCS"
,"(ClassRoom Cloud System), which enables participants to use the cloud"

,value of participants by using entropy-weight method and data mining

AB,This study focuses on exploiting Call Detail Records (CDR) data in order
,"to detect the demand distribution among different zones within the day,"
,together with information about the type of activity that characterises
,each zone. Traffic zones are first identified and shaped through a
,"k-means clustering analysis. Then, the traffic between different"
,clusters is analysed with the aim to identify the type of zone by
,evaluating the traffic calls density for each time period. To evaluate
,"the propagation of the demand among the different zones, Markov Chains"
,theory is used in order to evaluate the transition matrix among
,different time steps. The developed model enables one to predict CDR
,"variations in time and space and, hence, being a proxy for the trip"
,distribution. Results point out how these matrices are similar for
,"consecutive time intervals; therefore, it is possible to aggregate them"
,"in an hourly transition matrix, losing a small amount of information"
,over the structure of the demand. This also shows that trip distribution
,varies relatively slowly in time and is spatially consistent along the
,days.

AB,The needs for cheaper and less intrusive ways to collect activity-travel
,"diaries led scientist to pursue new technologies, e.g., positioning"
,"technologies like GPS. While a fully, reliable and widely accepted"
,automatic activity-travel diary collection system is yet to be
,"developed, scientists have presented systems that automate parts of an"
,"activity-travel diary collection. In the advent of automated systems, it"
,is important to discuss how to analyse the potential of such systems and
,how to compare different activity-travel diary collection systems. To
,"achieve this objective, this paper introduces a parallel survey design"
,and a comparison framework for collection systems. The framework can be
,"used as a development tool to optimise system design, to report and"
,"monitor progress of different system designs, to objectively weigh"
,"benefits in decision making, and to automate systematic analysis. In"
,"particular, the framework can be used as a comparison tool to reveal the"
,qualitative difference in the data gathered using different collection
,"systems. To achieve this, the framework defines: 1) a number of"
,"activity-travel diary measurement entities (trips and triplegs), entity"
,"attributes (e.g., trip purpose, origin /destination, etc.), 2)"
,"similarity functions between instances of the same entities, and 3)"
,spatial and temporal quality indices to establish a notion of ground
,truth. The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by
,analysing the results of a trial survey where data is collected via two
,activity-travel collection systems: a web-based system (PP) and a
,smartphone-app-based system (MEILI). PP was collected for one day period
,and MEILI was used for one week period (with one day overlapping). The
,"results show that half of the trips are captured by both systems, while"
,each system roughly captures the same number of trips as the other. The
,strengths and weaknesses of MEILI are analysed using the framework on
,the entire week dataset.

AB,Context identifying based on speech data is important to social services
,"and city management. In a complex application environment, a speech"
,recognition system needs to address two main problems: background noises
,and large vocabulary search latency. We use the adjustment acoustic
,"model to deal with the scenario adaptation, and we use adjustment"
,dictionary and language module to solve the discourse topic recognition.
,"As a case study, we design and implement a continuous language speech"
,recognition system on a mobile smart terminal. Experiments show that the
,scene adaptation effectively improves the accuracy rate of speech
,"recognition, and the discourse topic recognition verifies the"
,recognition effectiveness of our speech recognition system.

AB,Trajectory data analysis has recently become an active research area.
,"This is due to the large availability of mobile tracking sensors, such"
,"as GPS-enabled smart phones. However, those GPS trackers only provide"
,"raw trajectories (x, y, t), ignoring information about the activity,"
,"transportation mode, etc. This information can contribute in producing"
,"significant knowledge about movements, which transforms raw trajectories"
,"into semantic trajectories. Therefore, research lately has focused on"
,"semantic trajectories; their representation, construction, and"
,applications. This paper investigates the current studies on semantic
,trajectories so far. We propose a new classification schema for the
,research efforts in semantic trajectory construction and applications.
,The proposed classification schema includes three main classes: semantic
,"trajectory modeling, computation, and applications. Besides, we discuss"
,the current research gaps found in this research area.

AB,"Transportation mode detection (TMD) is a growing field of research, in"
,"which a variety of methods have been developed, foremost for outdoor"
,travels. It has been employed in application areas such as public
,transportation and environmental footprint profiling. For indoor travels
,"the problem of TMD has received comparatively little attention, even"
,"though diverse transportation modes, such as biking and electric"
,"vehicles, are used indoors. The potential applications are diverse, and"
,"include scheduling and progress tracking for mobile workers, and"
,"management of vehicular resources. However, for indoor TMD, the physical"
,environment as well as the availability and reliability of sensing
,"resources differ drastically from outdoor scenarios. Therefore, many of"
,the methods developed for outdoor TMD cannot be easily and reliably
,applied indoors.
,"In this paper, we explore indoor transportation scenarios to arrive at a"
,"conceptual model of indoor transportation modes, and then compare"
,"challenges for outdoor and indoor TMD. In addition, we explore methods"
,"for TMD we deem suitable in indoor settings, and we perform an extensive"

,those break-points to obtain highway segment ends. We calculate the
,average velocity of vehicles traversing the regions between these

AB,The GPS-based travel survey is an emerging data collection method in
,transportation planning. The survey's application in trip mode detection
,has been explored in many studies. Most research on trip mode detection
,methods based on GPS data has been developed and tested with data
,collected from European and American countries. The methods cannot be
,"easily adapted to Asian countries such as China, India, and Japan, which"
,"have much higher population densities, more complex road networks, and"
,"highly mixed travel modes during daily commuting. Furthermore, for trip"
,"segment division in multimode travel, existing algorithms use travel"
,time and distance thresholds that are highly dependent on local travel
,behavior and lack universality across traffic environments This paper
,proposes an innovative framework for detecting trip modes in complex
,"urban environments. First, a smartphone application, GPSurvey, was"
,developed to collect passive GPS trace data. Then a wavelet transform
,modulus maximum algorithm was developed for trip segment division. The
,algorithm has outstanding capabilities for identifying singularity
,features of a signal; this factor suits the task of detecting mode
,changes in a complex traffic environment. A neural network module was
,developed for mode detection on the basis of cell phone GPS location and
,acceleration data. The results indicate that the proposed method has
,promising performance. The average absolute detection error of mode
,"transfer time was within 1 min, and the accuracy for detecting all modes"
,was greater than 85%.

,"inferring transportation modes as car, bus, walk, and bike. Despite some"
,"techniques show improvements in accuracy, researchers constantly deal"

,transportation modes. The data are collected from the Google API for

AB,This paper presented the measurement results of space charge
,distribution and high field conduction in cross-linked polyethylene
,(XLPE) plate sample at various electric fields for a broad temperature
,range from 30 to 90 degrees C. The temperature effect on charge trapping
,and transport mechanism is discussed based on estimation of threshold
,characteristic and apparent mobility. It is shown that the threshold
,field for space charge accumulation apparently decreased with the
,"temperature, probably associated with acceleration of charge injection"
,and ionic dissociation. The apparent mobility of charges showed an
,"exponential dependence on temperature, which indicates enhancement of"
,charge detrapping and transfer rate at higher temperature. The field
,"dependence of the space charge decreases with the temperature, results"
,in more space charge accumulate at room temperature than at high
,temperature at certain high field. This behavior indicates that the
,space charge formation rate increases slower than the charge detrapping
,"rate as the temperature increases. Besides, negative charge is always"
,dominant in the sample at the measuring field and temperature range.
,This is probably due to stronger electron injection at XLPE-aluminum
,interface or more negative ion formed by dissociation of chemical
,species.

,"behaviors are being continuously captured from mobile phones, wireless"

,important foundation for understanding individuals' mobility behaviors.
,"For instance, recent studies show that, despite the dissimilarity in the"
,"mobility areas covered by individuals, there is high regularity in the"
,"human mobility behaviors, suggesting that most individuals follow a"
,simple and reproducible pattern. This survey paper reviews relevant
,"results on uncovering mobility patterns from GPS datasets. Specially, it"
,covers the results about inferring locations of significance for
,"prediction of future moves, detecting modes of transport, mining"
,trajectory patterns and recognizing locationbased activities. The survey
,provides a general perspective for studies on the issues of individuals'
,mobility by reviewing the methods and algorithms in detail and comparing
,the existing results on the same issues. Several new and emergent issues
,concerning individuals' mobility are proposed for further research. (C)

AB,The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in
,"recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between"
,users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS
,trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie
,"between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations."
,Different from previous work using social structures or directly
,"matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS"
,"trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping"
,"malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between"
,different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm.
,"The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries"
,more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic
,"positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two"
,"users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in"
,"different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential"
,"property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We"
,evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109
,users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a
,physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several
,widely used sequence matching approaches given this application
,scenario.

,Others require objects to move at similar speed and yet others consider
,movement similar if it occurs at the same time. We believe that a

,which similarity measures are scarce or entirely missing.
,"In this review paper we, first, decompose movement into its spatial,"
,"temporal, and spatiotemporal movement parameters. A movement parameter"
,"is a physical quantity of movement, such as speed, spatial path, or"
,temporal duration. For each of these parameters we then review
,"qualitative and quantitative methods of how to compare movement. Thus,"

,"For the friendship prediction, we achieved an overall recognition rate"

AB,Individual human travel patterns captured by mobile phone data have been
,"quantitatively characterized by mathematical models, but the underlying"
,activities which initiate the movement are still in a less-explored
,stage. As a result of the nature of how activity and related travel
,"decisions are made in daily life, human activity-travel behavior"
,exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal regularities as well as
,"sequential ordering. In this study, we investigate to what extent the"
,behavioral routines could reveal the activities being performed at
,mobile phone call locations that are captured when users initiate or
,receive a voice call or message.
,"Our exploration consists of four steps. First, we define a set of"
,comprehensive temporal variables characterizing each call location.
,Feature selection techniques are then applied to choose the most
,"effective variables in the second step. Next, a set of state-of-the-art"
,"machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Logistic"
,"Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests are employed to build"
,"classification models. Alongside, an ensemble of the results of the"
,"above models is also tested. Finally, the inference performance is"
,further enhanced by a post-processing algorithm.
,Using data collected from natural mobile phone communication patterns of
,"80 users over a period of more than one year, we evaluated our approach"
,"via a set of extensive experiments. Based on the ensemble of the models,"
,"we achieved prediction accuracy of 69.7%. Furthermore, using the post"
,"processing algorithm, the performance obtained a 7.6% improvement. The"
,experiment results demonstrate the potential to annotate mobile phone
,locations based on the integration of data mining techniques with the

AB,"With the large-scale adoption of GPS equipped mobile sensing devices,"
,"positional data generated by moving objects (e.g., vehicles, people,"
,animals) are being easily collected. Such data are typically modeled as
,"streams of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points, called trajectories. In"
,recent years trajectory management research has progressed significantly
,"towards efficient storage and indexing techniques, as well as suitable"
,knowledge discovery. These works focused on the geometric aspect of the
,raw mobility data. We are now witnessing a growing demand in several
,"application sectors (e.g., from shipment tracking to geo-social"

,Semantic behavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of the raw
,"mobility data, including not only geometric patterns but also knowledge"
,extracted jointly from the mobility data and the underlying geographic
,and application domains information. The core contribution of this
,article lies in a semantic model and a computation and annotation
,platform for developing a semantic approach that progressively
,transforms the raw mobility data into semantic trajectories enriched
,with segmentations and annotations. We also analyze a number of

AB,"The knowledge of the transportation mode used by humans (e.g. bicycle,"
,"on foot, car and train) is critical for travel behaviour research,"
,"transport planning and traffic management. Nowadays, new technologies"
,such as the Global Positioning System have replaced traditional survey
,"methods (paper diaries, telephone) because they are more accurate and"
,"problems such as under reporting are avoided. However, although the"
,movement data collected (timestamped positions in digital form) have
,"generally high accuracy, they do not contain the transportation mode. We"
,present in this article a new method for segmenting movement data into
,single-mode segments and for classifying them according to the
,transportation mode used. Our fully automatic method differs from
,previous attempts for five reasons: (1) it relies on fuzzy concepts
,"found in expert systems, that is membership functions and certainty"
,factors; (2) it uses OpenStreetMap data to help the segmentation and
,classification process; (3) we can distinguish between 10 transportation
,"modes (including between tram, bus and car) and propose a hierarchy; (4)"
,"it handles data with signal shortages and noise, and other real-life"
,"situations; (5) in our implementation, there is a separation between the"
,"reasoning and the knowledge, so that users can easily modify the"
,parameters used and add new transportation modes. We have implemented
,the method and tested it with a 17-million point data set collected in
,the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. The accuracy of the

AB,"Because of the rapid development of technology, larger data sets on"
,activity travel behavior have become available. These data sets often
,lack semantic interpretation. This lack of interpretation implies that
,annotation of activity type and transportation mode is necessary. This
,paper aims to infer activity types from Global Positioning System (GPS)
,traces by developing a decision tree based model. The model considers
,only activity start times and activity durations. On the basis of the
,"decision tree classification, a probability distribution and a point"
,prediction model were constructed. The probability matrix described the
,"probability of each activity type for each class (i.e., combination of"
,"activity start time and activity duration). In each class, the point"
,prediction model selected the activity type that had the highest
,probability. Two types of data were collected in 2006 and 2007 in
,"Flanders, Belgium (i.e., activity travel data and GPS data). The optimal"
,"classification tree constructed contained 18 leaves. Consequently, 18 if"
,then rules were derived. An accuracy of 74% was achieved when the tree
,was trained. The accuracy of the model for the validation set (72.5%)
,showed that overfitting was minimal. When the model was applied to the
,"test set, the accuracy was almost 76%. The models indicated the"
,importance of time information in the semantic enrichment process. This
,study contributes to future data collection in that it enables
,researchers to infer activity types directly from activity start time
,and duration information obtained from GPS data. Because no location
,"information is needed, this research can be easily and readily applied"
,to millions of individual agents.

AB,Moving objects databases should be able to manage trips that pass
,"through several real world environments, e.g., road network, indoor."
,"However, the current data models only deal with the movement in one"
,situation and cannot represent comprehensive trips for humans who can
,"move inside a building, walk on the pavement, drive on the road, take"
,"the public vehicles (bus or train), etc. As a result, existing queries"
,"are solely limited to one environment. In this paper, we design a data"
,model that is able to represent moving objects in multiple environments
,in order to support novel queries on trips in different surroundings and
,"various transportation modes (e.g., Car, Walk, Bus). A generic and"
,precise location representation is proposed that can apply in all
,environments. The idea is to let the space for moving objects be covered
,by a set of so-called infrastructures each of which corresponds to an
,"environment and defines the available places for moving objects. Then,"
,the location is represented by referencing to the infrastructure. We
,formulate the concept of space and infrastructure and propose the
,methodology to represent moving objects in different environments with
,the integration of precise transportation modes. Due to different
,"infrastructure characteristics, a set of novel data types is defined to"
,"represent infrastructure components. To efficiently support new queries,"
,we design a group of operators to access the data. We present how such a
,data model is implemented in a database system and report the
,experimental results. The new model is designed with attention to the
,data models of previous work for free space and road networks to have a
,"consistent type system and framework of operators. In this way, a"
,"powerful set of generic query operations is available for querying,"
,together with those dealing with infrastructures and transportation
,modes. We demonstrate these capabilities by formulating a set of
,sophisticated queries across all infrastructures.

AB,Travel modes are one of the crucial pieces of information to
,characterize one's travel behavior. In recent years several approaches
,of mode detection from GPS data have been proposed. The approach
,presented in this paper uses machine learning to evaluate a set of
,"GPS-based features for their ability to recognize the common modes walk,"
,"bicycle, car, bus, and train. The proposed features describe motion"
,characteristics from GPS-trajectories by relative frequencies. Compared
,to previous work the proposed feature set leads to higher average
,recognition rates around 92% without relying on additional GIS or
,real-time information. The evaluation compares detection rates from
,"multilayer perceptrons, logistic model trees, and C4.5 decision trees"
,and is complemented by an evolutionary feature selection for selecting
,the most beneficial feature subsets leading to the best quality gain. In
,"contrast to other research, this study uses a comparatively large set of"
,400 GPS trajectories which have been recorded in rural and urban
,European areas. Results contribute to a higher reliability as well as a
,broader applicability of GPS-only travel mode detection.

AB,Travel modes are one of the crucial pieces of information to
,characterize one's travel behavior. In recent years several approaches
,of mode detection from GPS data have been proposed. The approach
,presented in this paper uses machine learning to evaluate a set of
,"GPS-based features for their ability to recognize the common modes walk,"
,"bicycle, car, bus, and train. The proposed features describe motion"
,characteristics from GPS-trajectories by relative frequencies. Compared
,to previous work the proposed feature set leads to higher average
,recognition rates around 92% without relying on additional GIS or
,real-time information. The evaluation compares detection rates from
,"multilayer perceptrons, logistic model trees, and C4.5 decision trees"
,and is complemented by an evolutionary feature selection for selecting
,the most beneficial feature subsets leading to the best quality gain. In
,"contrast to other research, this study uses a comparatively large set of"
,400 GPS trajectories which have been recorded in rural and urban
,European areas. Results contribute to a higher reliability as well as a
,broader applicability of GPS-only travel mode detection.

AB,Data transfers scheduling is an important part of almost all distributed
,virtual walkthrough (DVW) applications. Its main purpose is to preserve
,data transfer efficiency and render quality during scene exploration.
,The most limiting factors here are network restrictions such as low
,bandwidth and high latency. Current scheduling algorithms use
,"multi-resolution data representation, priority determination and data"
,prefetching algorithms to minimize these restrictions. Advanced priority
,determination and data prefetching methods for DVW applications use
,mathematic description of motion to predict next position of each
,individual user. These methods depend on the recent motion of a user so
,that they can accurately predict only near locations. In the case of
,sudden but regular changes in user motion direction (road networks) or
,"fast moving user, these algorithms are not sufficient to predict future"
,position with required accuracy and at required distances. In this paper
,we propose a systematic solution to scheduling of data transfer for DVW
,applications which uses next location prediction methods to compute
,download priority or additionally prefetch rendered data in advance.
,Experiments show that compared to motion functions the proposed
,scheduling scheme can increase data transfer efficiency and rendered
,image quality during scene exploration.

AB,With the use of individual-level travel survey datasets describing the
,"detailed activities of households, it is possible to analyze human"
,"movements with a high degree of precision. However, travel survey data"
,are not without quality issues. Potential exists for origins and
,"destinations of reported trips not to be geo-referenced, perhaps due to"
,"misreported information or inconsistencies in spatial address databases,"
,which can limit the usefulness of the survey data. From an analytical
,"standpoint, this is a serious problem because a single unreferenced stop"
,"in a trip record in effect renders that individual's data useless,"
,especially in cases where analyzing chains of activity locations is of
,interest. This paper presents a framework and basic computational
,approach for exploring unlocatable activity locations inherent to travel
,"surveys. Derived from recent work in developing a network-based,"
,"probabilistic time geography, the proposed methods are able to estimate"
,the likely locations of missing trip origins and destinations. The
,methods generate probabilistic potential path trees which are used to
,visualize and quantify potential locations for the unreferenced
,destinations. The methods are demonstrated with simulated survey data
,from a smaller metropolitan area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

,the recognition of maintenance-related activities. The presented work
,focuses on the spotting of subtle hand actions in a continuous stream of
,data based on a combination of body-mounted motion sensors and
,ultrasonic positioning. The spotting and recognition approach is based
,on three core ideas: (1) the use of location information to compensate
,"for the ambiguity of hand motions, (2) the use of motion data to"
,compensate for the slow sampling rate and unreliable signal of the low
,"cost ultrasonic positioning system, and (3) an incremental, multistage"
,spotting methodology. The proposed methods are evaluated in an elaborate
,bicycle repair experiment containing nearly 10 h of data from six
,subjects. The evaluation compares different strategies and system
,variants and shows that precision and recall rates around 90% can be
,achieved.

AB,The goal of Internet of Things (IoT) research is to extend computing and
,"connectivity to anything, anyone, anywhere and anytime. While there are"
,"apparent benefits in using IoT systems, the convergence of technologies"
,has begun to challenge the privacy of users. Powered by location based
,"services, these systems have the potential to enable a systematic mass"
,"surveillance and to impinge on the personal privacy of users, especially"
,their location privacy. This paper overviews some of the existing
,location privacy issues found on mobile devices. Particular attention is
,"paid to the current access permission mechanism used on the Android,"
,iPhone and Windows Mobile platforms. It is anticipated that the current
,privacy issues in mobile platforms are more likely to be inherited if

,"real-time recommendation. Firstly, we capture the historical pick-up"
,points by analyzing their intervals. These points are clustered at
,different time and different regions to create - candidate pick-up
,"points. Secondly, after ranking the candidate pick-up points around the"
,"taxi, the top-5 valuable pick-up points are recommended for taxi"
,"drivers. The experimental results, whose data come from Microsoft"
,"Research Asia, show that our method can effectively recommend pick-up"

,patterns and behavior of traffic crowds. Its objective is to predict the
,"most likely or ""popular"" route of road segments from a given point in a"
,road network. This paper presents a hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric
,approach to efficient and scalable route prediction that can harness the
,wisdom of crowds of route planning agents by aggregating their
,sequential routes of possibly varying lengths and origin-destination
,"pairs. In particular, our approach has the advantages of (a) not"
,requiring a Markov assumption to be imposed and (b) generalizing well
,"with sparse data, thus resulting in significantly improved prediction"
,"accuracy, as demonstrated empirically using real-world taxi route data."
,We also show two practical applications of our route prediction
,algorithm: predictive taxi ranking and route recommendation.

AB,Recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human
,"activity can be learned from GPS (positional) data. However, most effort"
,to date has concentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical
,"properties of groups of people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on"
,modeling actual successful executions (and not failed or attempted
,"executions) of the activities of interest. We, in contrast, take on the"
,"task of understanding human interactions, attempted interactions, and"
,intentions from noisy sensor data in a fully relational multi-agent
,setting. We use a real-world game of capture the flag to illustrate our
,approach in a well-defined domain that involves many distinct
,cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain using
,"Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that"
,jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level
,"activities, such as a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model"
,"combines constraints imposed by the geometry of the game area, the"
,"motion model of the players, and by the rules and dynamics of the game"
,in a probabilistically and logically sound fashion. We show that while
,it may be impossible to directly detect a multi-agent activity due to
,"sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the activity can still be"
,inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the
,people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it.
,"Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed"
,"multi-agent activities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts"
,"at the same activities, our system automatically learns an augmented"
,"model that is capable of recognizing success and failure, as well as"
,goals of people's actions with high accuracy. We compare our approach
,"with other alternatives and show that our unified model, which takes"
,"into account not only relationships among individual players, but also"
,"relationships among activities over the entire length of a game,"
,"although more computationally costly, is significantly more accurate."
,"Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessful attempts"
,boosts performance on other important recognition tasks.

AB,"The number of mobile Internet users is growing rapidly, as well as the"
,"capability of mobile Internet devices. As a result, the enormous amount"
,of traffic generated everyday on mobile Internet is pushing cellular
,services to their limits. We see great potential in the idea of
,scheduling the transmission of delay tolerant data towards times when
,"the network condition is better. However, such scheduling requires good"
,"network condition prediction, which has not been effectively tackled in"
,"previous research. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Hidden Markov"
,Model (DHMM) to model the time dependent and location dependent network
,conditions observed by individual users. The model is dynamic since
,transition matrix and states are updated when new observations are
,"available. On the other hand, it has all the properties of a Hidden"
,Markov Model. DHMM can predict precisely the next state given the
,"current state, hence can provide a good prediction of network condition."
,"DHMM has two layers, the top layer is Received Signal Strength (RSS) and"
,"the bottom layer consists of states, defined as a mixture of location,"
,time and the signal strength itself. Since the state is defined as a
,"mixture, it is hidden and the number of states is also not known a"
,"priori. Thus, the Nonparametric Bayesian Classification is applied to"
,determine the hidden states. We show through simulations that when
,"combined with a Markov decision process, the opportunistic scheduling"
,can reduce transmission costs up to 50.34% compared with a naive
,approach.

AB,The most difficult-and often most essential-aspect of many interception
,and tracking tasks is constructing motion models of the targets. Experts
,rarely can provide complete information about a target's expected motion
,"pattern, and fitting parameters for complex motion patterns can require"
,large amounts of training data. Specifying how to parameterize complex
,motion patterns is in itself a difficult task.
,"In contrast, Bayesian nonparametric models of target motion are very"
,flexible and generalize well with relatively little training data. We
,propose modeling target motion patterns as a mixture of Gaussian
,processes (GP) with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior over mixture weights.
,The GP provides an adaptive representation for each individual motion
,"pattern, while the DP prior allows us to represent an unknown number of"
,motion patterns. Both automatically adjust the complexity of the motion
,model based on the available data. Our approach outperforms several
,parametric models on a helicopter-based car-tracking task on data
,collected from the greater Boston area.

AB,"Over the last few years, electronic vehicle guidance systems have become"
,"increasingly more popular. However, despite their ubiquity, performance"

,Most current digital maps are still inadequate for advanced applications

AB,There is growing interest in the ways in which the location of a person
,can be utilized by new applications and services. Recent advances in
,mobile technologies have meant that the technical capability to record
,and transmit location data for processing is appearing in off-the-shelf
,handsets. This opens possibilities to profile people based on the places
,"they visit, people they associate with, or other aspects of their"
,complex routines determined through persistent tracking. It is possible
,that services offering customized information based on the results of
,"such behavioral profiling could become commonplace. However, it may not"
,be immediately apparent to the user that a wealth of information about
,"them, potentially unrelated to the service, can be revealed. Further"
,"issues occur if the user agreed, while subscribing to the service, for"
,data to be passed to third parties where it may be used to their
,"detriment. Here, we report in detail on a short case study tracking four"
,"people, in three European member states, persistently for six weeks"
,using mobile handsets. The GPS locations of these people have been mined
,to reveal places of interest and to create simple profiles. The
,information drawn from the profiling activity ranges from intuitive
,"through special cases to insightful. In this paper, these results and"
,further extensions to the technology are considered in light of European
,legislation to assess the privacy implications of this emerging
,technology.

AB,"To setup efficient wireless mesh networks, it is fundamental to limit"
,the overhead needed to localize a mobile user. A promising approach is
,to rely on a rendezvous-based location system where the current location
,of a mobile node is stored at specific nodes called locators.
,"Nevertheless, such a solution has a drawback, which happens when the"
,locator is far from the source-destination shortest path. This results
,in a triangular location problem and consequently in increased overhead
,of signaling messages. One solution to prevent this problem would be to
,place the locator as close as possible to the mobile node. This requires
,however to predict the mobile node's location at all times. To obtain
,"such information, we define a mobility prediction model (an agenda)"
,"that, for each node, specifies the mesh router that is likely to be the"
,closest to the mobile node at specific time periods. The location
,service that we propose formalizes the integration of the agenda with
,the management of location servers in a coherent and self-organized
,fashion. To evaluate the performance of our system compared to
,"traditional approaches, we use two real-life mobility datasets of Wi-Fi"
,devices in the Dartmouth campus and Taxicabs in the bay area of San
,Francisco. We show that our strategy significantly outperforms
,traditional solutions; we obtain gains ranging from 39 to 72% compared
,to the centralized scheme and more than 35% compared to a traditional
,rendezvous-based solution.

AB,"The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS,"
,"GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with"
,"spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some"
,"extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to"
,"understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article,"
,we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and
,location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on
,"the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's"
,visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their
,"implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity"
,between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each
,"user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate"
,an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving
,his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited
,locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the
,"individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based"
,"similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each"
,"individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity"
,"among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1)"
,"the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited"
,"popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of"
,"geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into"
,"a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the"
,"user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We"
,evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75
,"subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM"
,"outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count,"
,"cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the"
,"item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides"
,users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of
,recommendation.

AB,In this paper we analyze a class of location disclosure in which
,"location information from individuals is generated in an automated way,"
,i.e. is observed by a ubiquitous infrastructure. Since such information
,"is valuable for both scientific research and commercial use, location"
,information might be passed on to third parties. Users are usually aware
,neither of the extent of the information disclosure (e.g. by carrying a
,"mobile phone), nor how the collected data is used and by whom."
,In order to assess the expected privacy risk in terms of the possible
,"extent of exposure, we propose an adversary model and a privacy metric"
,that allow an evaluation of the possible privacy loss by using mobile
,"communication infrastructure. Furthermore, a case study on the privacy"
,effects of using GSM infrastructure was conducted with the goal of
,analyzing the side effects of using a mobile handset. Based on these
,results requirements for a privacy-aware mobile handheld device were
,derived.

AB,Virtual world user models have similarities with hypertext system user
,models. User knowledge and preferences may be derived from the locations
,users visit or recommend. The models can represent topics of interest
,"for the user based on the subject or content of visited locations, and"
,corresponding location models can enable matching between users and
,"locations. However, virtual worlds also present challenges and"
,opportunities that differ from hypertext worlds. Content collection for
,a cross-world search and recommendation service may be more difficult in
,"virtual worlds, and there is less text available for analysis. In some"
,"cases, though, extra information is available to add to user and content"
,"profiles enhance the matching ability of the system. In this paper, we"
,present a content collection system for Second Life and OpenSimulator
,"virtual worlds, as well as user and location models derived from the"
,"collected content. The models incorporate text, social proximity, and"
,metadata attributes to create hybrid user models for representing user
,interests and preferences. The models are evaluated based on their
,ability to match content popularity and observed user behavior.

,Existing techniques based on linear and probabilistic models are not
,able to provide accurate prediction of the location patterns from a
,"spatio-temporal perspective, especially for long-term estimation. More"
,"specifically, they are able to only forecast the next location of a"
,"user, but not his/her arrival time and residence time, i.e., the"
,"interval of time spent in that location. Moreover, these techniques are"
,often based on prediction models that are not able to extend predictions
,further in the future.
,"In this paper we present NextPlace, a novel approach to location"
,prediction based on nonlinear time series analysis of the arrival and
,residence times of users in relevant places. NextPlace focuses on the
,predictability of single users when they visit their most important
,"places, rather than on the transitions between different locations. We"
,report about our evaluation using four different datasets and we compare
,our forecasting results to those obtained by means of the prediction
,techniques proposed in the literature. We show how we achieve higher
,performance compared to other predictors and also more stability over

AB,Location and tracking of healthy or infirm elders is a potentially

,technologies such as cellular positioning and Assisted Global
,Positioning System (AGPS) are maturing. For a wearable device to be used
,"in such an application, the battery operating hour is often a key"

,AGPS tracking algorithm based on the concept of Personal Common Location
,(PCL) that we define as the locations at which an elder spends most of
,"his/her time, as recognized from historic cell ID record. During the"
,"tracking process, AGPS fixes are avoided if the elderly carrier is"
,"determined to be located within a PCL, if the destination PCL can be"
,"predicted, or if AGPS signals are likely to be unavailable. This paper"
,"also describes our approach for off-line PCL recognition, the necessity"
,"of cell ID clustering, as well as the results from our tracking"

,fragmentation detects the changes of the travelling pace and decomposes
,the GPS trace into a large number of small fragments according the
,traveling pace while the defragmentation composes adjacent fragments
,into one fragment which is inside the AOI. The focusing provides a
,Focus+Context+Glue map where the Focus is an area of a large-scale map
,including the AOI that enables users to understand details of the AOI.

AB,The advance of GPS-enabled devices allows people to record their
,"location histories with GPS traces, which imply human behaviors and"
,"preferences related to travel. In this article, we perform two types of"
,travel recommendations by mining multiple users' GPS traces. The first
,is a generic one that recommends a user with top interesting locations
,and travel sequences in a given geospatial region. The second is a
,personalized recommendation that provides an individual with locations
,"matching her travel preferences. To achieve the first recommendation, we"
,model multiple users' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical
,"graph (TBHG). Based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced"
,Topic Search)-based model to infer the interest level of a location and
,a user's travel experience (knowledge). In the personalized
,"recommendation, we first understand the correlation between locations,"
,and then incorporate this correlation into a collaborative filtering
,"(CF)-based model, which predicts a user's interests in an unvisited"
,location based on her locations histories and that of others. We
,evaluated our system based on a real-world GPS trace dataset collected
,"by 107 users over a period of one year. As a result, our HITS-based"
,inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and

AB,Modern technology has brought many changes to our everyday lives. Our
,need to be in constant touch with others has been met with the
,"cellphone, which has become our companion and the convergence point of"
,many technological advances. The combination of capabilities such as
,browsing the Internet and GPS reception has multiplied the services and
,"applications based on the current location of the user. However,"
,providing the user with these services has certain drawbacks. Although
,map navigation systems are the most meaningful way of displaying this
,"information, the user still has to manually set up the filter in order"
,to obtain a non-bloated visualization of the map and the available
,"services. To tackle this problem, we present here a semantic"
,multicriteria ant colony algorithm capable of learning the user's
,"routes, including associated context information, and then predicting"
,"the most likely route a user is following, given his current location"
,and context data. We also propose an affective component for the
,algorithm that will add a value to routes likelihood score so it will
,emphasize those predicted routes that could affect positively user
,experience or emotional state. This knowledge could then be used as the
,basis for offering services related to his current ( or most likely
,future) context data close to the path he is following.

AB,Location is a key context ingredient and many existing pervasive
,"applications rely on the current locations of their users. However, with"
,the ability to predict the future location and movement behavior of a
,"user, the usability of these applications can be greatly improved. In"
,"this paper, we propose an approach to predict both the intended"
,destination and the future route of a person. Rather than predicting the
,"destination and future route separately, we have focused on making"
,prediction in an integrated way by exploiting personal movement data
,(i.e. trajectories) collected by GPS. Since trajectories contain daily
,"whereabouts information of a person, the proposed approach first detects"
,the significant places where the person may depart from or go to using a
,"clustering-based algorithm called FBM (Forward Backward Matching), then"
,"abstracts the trajectories based on a space partitioning method, and"
,finally extracts movement patterns from the abstracted trajectories
,using an extended CRPM (Continuous Route Pattern Mining) algorithm.
,Extracted movement patterns are organized in terms of origin-destination
,couples. The prediction is made based on a pattern tree built from these
,movement patterns. With the real personal movement data of 14
,"participants, we conducted a number of experiments to evaluate the"
,performance of our system. The results show that our approach can
,achieve approximately 80% and 60% accuracy in destination prediction and
,"1-step prediction, respectively, and result in an average deviation of"
,"approximately 60 m in continuous future route prediction. Finally, based"
,"on the proposed approach, we implemented a prototype running on mobile"
,"phones, which can extract patterns from a user's historical movement"
,data and predict the destination and future route. (C) 2010 Elsevier

,"paper, we develop a novel methodology to reveal cabdrivers' operation"

,"time, we systematically study large scale cabdrivers' behavior in a real"

,"million kilometers to uncover: (1) spatial selection behavior, (2)"
,"context-aware spatio-temporal operation behavior, (3) route choice"

AB,Pervasive computing creates possibilities for presenting highly
,"personalised information about the people, places and things in a"
,building. One of the challenges for such personalisation is the creation
,of the system that can support ontological reasoning for several key
,tasks: reasoning about location; personalisation of information about
,location at the right level of detail; and personalisation to match each
,person's conceptions of the building based on their own use of it and
,their relationship to other people in the building. From pragmatic
,"perspectives, it should be inexpensive to create the ontology for each"
,new building. It is also critical that users should be able to
,understand and control pervasive applications. We created the PERSONAF
,(personalised pervasive scrutable ontological framework) to address
,these challenges. PERSONAF is a new abstract framework for pervasive
,"ontological reasoning. We report its evaluation at three levels. First,"
,we assessed the power of the ontology for reasoning about noisy and
,"uncertain location information, showing that PERSONAF can improve"
,"location modelling. Notably, the best ontological reasoner varies across"
,"users. Second, we demonstrate the use of the PERSONAF framework in"
,"Adaptive Locator, an application built upon it, using our low cost"
,"mechanisms for non-generic layers of the ontology. Finally, we report a"
,"user study, which evaluated the PERSONAF approach as seen by users in"
,the Adaptive Locator. We assessed both the personalisation performance
,and the understandability of explanations of the system reasoning.
,"Together, these three evaluations show that the PERSONAF approach"
,"supports building of low cost ontologies, that can achieve flexible"
,"ontological reasoning about smart buildings and the people in them, and"
,that this can be used to build applications which give personalised
,information that can provide understandable explanations of the
,reasoning underlying the personalisation.

PY,2010
AB,This paper introduces a novel method of generating mobility traces based
,on Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs). A PCFG is a
,generalization of a context free grammar in which each production rule
,is augmented with a probability with which this production is applied
,during sentence generation. A concise PCFG can be inferred from the
,given real world trace collected from the actual mobile node behaviors.
,The resulting grammar can be used to generate sequences of arbitrary
,length mimicking the mobile node behavior. This is important when new
,protocol designs for mobile networks are tested by simulation.
,"In the paper, we describe the methods developed to construct such"
,grammars from training data (mobility history). We also discuss how to
,generate the synthetic data with an already constructed grammar. We
,"present the experimental results on two real data sets, measuring"
,similarity of the actual traces with the synthetic ones. We compare our
,grammar based method to a 2-level Markov Model based trace generation
,method. The results demonstrate that the grammar based approach works as
,"an excellent compression method for the actual data. On many metrics,"
,the synthetic data generated from the PCFG match the training data much
,better than the one generated by the Markov Model.

AB,"User mobility has given rise to a variety of Web applications, in which"
,the global positioning system (GPS) plays many important roles in
,bridging between these applications and end users. As a kind of human
,"behavior, transportation modes, such as walking and driving, can provide"
,pervasive computing systems with more contextual information and enrich
,"a user's mobility with informative knowledge. In this article, we report"
,on an approach based on supervised learning to automatically infer
,"users' transportation modes, including driving, walking, taking a bus"
,"and riding a bike, from raw GPS logs. Our approach consists of three"
,"parts: a change point-based segmentation method, an inference model and"
,"a graph-based post-processing algorithm. First, we propose a change"
,point-based segmentation method to partition each GPS trajectory into
,"separate segments of different transportation modes. Second, from each"
,"segment, we identify a set of sophisticated features, which are not"
,"affected by differing traffic conditions ( e. g., a person's direction"
,when in a car is constrained more by the road than any change in traffic
,"conditions). Later, these features are fed to a generative inference"
,"model to classify the segments of different modes. Third, we conduct"
,graph-based postprocessing to further improve the inference performance.
,This postprocessing algorithm considers both the commonsense constraints
,of the real world and typical user behaviors based on locations in a
,probabilistic manner. The advantages of our method over the related
,works include three aspects. ( 1) Our approach can effectively segment
,trajectories containing multiple transportation modes. ( 2) Our work
,"mined the location constraints from user-generated GPS logs, while being"
,independent of additional sensor data and map information like road
,networks and bus stops. ( 3) The model learned from the dataset of some
,users can be applied to infer GPS data from others. Using the GPS logs
,"collected by 65 people over a period of 10 months, we evaluated our"
,"approach via a set of experiments. As a result, based on the"
,change-point-based segmentation method and Decision Tree-based inference
,"model, we achieved prediction accuracy greater than 71 percent. Further,"
,"using the graph-based post-processing algorithm, the performance"
,attained a 4-percent enhancement.

AB,We present a fast algorithm for probabilistically extracting significant
,locations from raw GPS data based on data point density. Extracting
,significant locations from raw GPS data is the first essential step of
,algorithms designed for location-aware applications. Assuming that a
,"location is significant if users spend a certain time around that area,"
,"most current algorithms compare spatial/temporal variables, such as stay"
,"duration and a roaming diameter, with given fixed thresholds to extract"
,"significant locations. However, the appropriate threshold values are not"
,clearly known in priori and algorithms with fixed thresholds are
,"inherently error-prone, especially under high noise levels. Moreover,"
,"for N data points, they are generally O(N-2) algorithms since distance"
,computation is required. We developed a fast algorithm for selective
,data point sampling around significant locations based on density
,information by constructing random histograms using locality sensitive
,hashing. Evaluations show competitive performance in detecting
,significant locations even under high noise levels.

AB,Constructing models of mobile agents can be difficult without
,domain-specific knowledge. Parametric models flexible enough to capture
,all mobility patterns that an expert believes are possible are often
,"large, requiring a great deal of training data. In contrast,"
,nonparametric models are extremely flexible and can generalize well with
,relatively little training data. We propose modeling the mobility
,patterns of moving agents as a mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) with a
,Dirichlet process (DP) prior over mixture weights. The GP provides a
,"flexible representation for each individual mobility pattern, while the"
,DP assigns observed trajectories to particular mobility patterns. Both
,the GPs and the DP adjust the model's complexity based on available
,"data, implicitly avoiding issues of over-fitting or under-fitting. We"
,"apply our model to a helicopter-based tracking task, where the mobility"
,patterns of the tracked agents-cars-are learned from real data collected
,from taxis in the greater Boston area.

AB,Background: Our understanding of the effects of human movement on dengue
,virus spread remains limited in part due to the lack of precise tools to
,monitor the time-dependent location of individuals. We determined the
,"utility of a new, commercially available, GPS data-logger for long-term"
,"tracking of human movements in Iquitos, Peru. We conducted a series of"
,evaluations focused on GPS device attributes key to reliable use and
,accuracy. GPS observations from two participants were later compared
,with semi-structured interview data to assess the usefulness of GPS
,technology to track individual mobility patterns.
,"Results: Positional point and line accuracy were 4.4 and 10.3 m,"
,respectively. GPS wearing mode increased spatial point error by 6.9 m.
,Units were worn on a neck-strap by a carpenter and a moto-taxi driver
,for 14-16 days. The application of a clustering algorithm (I-cluster) to
,the raw GPS positional data allowed the identification of locations
,visited by each participant together with the frequency and duration of
,each visit. The carpenter moved less and spent more time in more fixed
,"locations than the moto-taxi driver, who visited more locations for a"
,shorter period of time. GPS and participants' interviews concordantly
,"identified 6 common locations, whereas GPS alone identified 4 locations"
,and participants alone identified 10 locations. Most (80%) of the
,locations identified by participants alone were places reported as
,visited for less than 30 minutes.
,"Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel,"
,commercially available GPS data-logger for long-term tracking of humans
,and shows the potential of these units to quantify mobility patterns in
,relationship with dengue virus transmission risk in a tropical urban
,"environment. Cost, battery life, size, programmability and ease of wear"
,"are unprecedented from previously tested units, proving the usefulness"
,of GPS-dataloggers for linking movement of individuals and transmission
,"risk of dengue virus and other infectious agents, particularly in"
,resource-poor settings.

AB,Background: Human movement is a key behavioral factor in many
,vector-borne disease systems because it influences exposure to vectors
,and thus the transmission of pathogens. Human movement transcends
,spatial and temporal scales with different influences on disease
,dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model to evaluate the importance
,of variation in exposure due to individual human movements for pathogen
,"transmission, focusing on mosquito-borne dengue virus."
,Methodology and Principal Findings: We develop a model showing that the
,relevance of human movement at a particular scale depends on vector
,"behavior. Focusing on the day-biting Aedes aegypti, we illustrate how"
,vector biting behavior combined with fine-scale movements of individual
,humans engaged in their regular daily routine can influence
,"transmission. Using a simple example, we estimate a transmission rate"
,(R(0)) of 1.3 when exposure is assumed to occur only in the home versus
,"3.75 when exposure at multiple locations-e. g., market, friend's-due to"
,movement is considered. Movement also influences for which sites and
,"individuals risk is greatest. For the example considered, intriguingly,"
,our model predicts little correspondence between vector abundance in a
,site and estimated R(0) for that site when movement is considered. This
,illustrates the importance of human movement for understanding and
,predicting the dynamics of a disease like dengue. To encourage
,"investigation of human movement and disease, we review methods currently"
,"available to study human movement and, based on our experience studying"
,"dengue in Peru, discuss several important questions to address when"
,designing a study.
,"Conclusions/Significance: Human movement is a critical, understudied"
,behavioral component underlying the transmission dynamics of many
,vector-borne pathogens. Understanding movement will facilitate
,identification of key individuals and sites in the transmission of
,"pathogens such as dengue, which then may provide targets for"
,"surveillance, intervention, and improved disease prevention."

AB,Longitudinal behavioral data generally contains a significant amount of
,"structure. In this work, we identify the structure inherent in daily"
,"behavior with models that can accurately analyze, predict, and cluster"
,multimodal data from individuals and communities within the social
,network of a population. We represent this behavioral structure by the
,"principal components of the complete behavioral dataset, a set of"
,"characteristic vectors we have termed eigenbehaviors. In our model, an"
,individual's behavior over a specific day can be approximated by a
,weighted sum of his or her primary eigenbehaviors. When these weights
,"are calculated halfway through a day, they can be used to predict the"
,day's remaining behaviors with 79% accuracy for our test subjects.
,"Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for this dimensionality"
,reduction technique to infer community affiliations within the subjects'
,"social network by clustering individuals into a ""behavior space"" spanned"
,by a set of their aggregate eigenbehaviors. These behavior spaces make
,it possible to determine the behavioral similarity between both
,"individuals and groups, enabling 96% classification accuracy of"
,community affiliations within the population-level social network.
,"Additionally, the distance between individuals in the behavior space can"
,"be used as an estimate for relational ties such as friendship,"
,suggesting strong behavioral homophily amongst the subjects. This
,approach capitalizes on the large amount of rich data previously
,captured during the Reality Mining study from mobile phones continuously
,"logging location, proximate phones, and communication of 100 subjects at"
,MIT over the course of 9 months. As wearable sensors continue to
,"generate these types of rich, longitudinal datasets, dimensionality"
,reduction techniques such as eigenbehaviors will play an increasingly
,important role in behavioral research.

AB,Services for mobile and pervasive computing should extensively exploit
,contextual information both to adapt to user needs and to enable
,autonomic behavior. To fulfill this idea it is important to provide two
,key tools: a model supporting context-data representation and
,"manipulation, and a set of algorithms relying on the model to perform"
,"application tasks. Following these lines, we first describe the W4"
,context model showing how it can represent a simple yet effective
,framework to enable flexible and general-purpose management of
,"contextual information. In particular, we show the model suitability in"
,"describing user-centric situations, e.g., describing situations in terms"
,"of where a user is located and what he is doing. Then, we illustrate a"
,set of algorithms to semantically enrich W4 represented data and to
,"extract relevant information from it. In particular, starting from W4"
,"data, such algorithms are able to identify the places that matter to the"
,"user and to describe them semantically. Overall, we show how the"
,"context-model and the algorithms allow to create an high-level, semantic"
,and context-aware diary-based service. This service meaningfully
,collects and classifies the user whereabouts and the places that the

,"Moreover, since radio signals change and fluctuate over time, map"

,problems in the context of user-generated place labels. By using an
,"accelerometer to detect whether a device is moving or stationary, the"

,"we propose a new method, called ""MARPL"", which uses Market Basket"

,"is best. Third, we propose that for network resource optimization,"
,predicting the aggregate location of a user ensemble may be of more

,"develop soft prediction methods, where the prediction is a spatial"

,methodologies to identify salient locations based on the network
,generated by tower transitions. The tower groupings from these
,unsupervised clustering techniques are subsequently validated using data
,from Bluetooth beacons placed in the homes of the subjects. We then use
,these inferred locations as states within several dynamic Bayesian
,networks (DBNs) to predict dwell times within locations and each
,subject's subsequent movements with over 90% accuracy. We also introduce
,"the X-Factor model, a DBN with a latent variable corresponding to"
,abnormal behavior. By calculating the entropy of the learned X-Factor

,cell phone users) movement patterns. The resulting model not only
,"provides us with an understanding of past mobile user movements, but"

,It has been found useful in both infrastructure-based wireless network

,nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian approach is proposed in this paper
,for extracting hierarchical mobility patterns from mobile user traces.
,Experiment results show that the proposed method is able to generate a

AB,Companies and organizations that track moving objects are interested in
,predicting the intended destination of these moving objects. We develop
,a formal model for destination prediction problems where the agent
,(Predictor) predicting a destination may not know anything about the
,route planning mechanism used by another agent (Target) nor does the
,agent have historical information about the target's past movements nor
,do the observations about the agent have to be complete (there may be
,gaps when the target was not seen). We develop axioms that any
,destination probability function should satisfy and then provide a broad
,family of such functions guaranteed to satisfy the axioms. We
,experimentally compare our work with an existing method for destination
,prediction using Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMMs). We found our
,algorithms to be faster than the existing method. Considering prediction
,"accuracy we found that, when the Predictor knows the route planning"
,"algorithm the target is using, the HSMM method is better, but without"
,this assumption our algorithm is better.

AB,The paths of 2425 individual motorcycle trips made in London were
,analyzed in order to uncover the route choice decisions made by drivers.
,The paths were derived from global positioning system (GPS) data
,"collected by a courier company for each of their drivers, using"
,algorithms developed for the purpose of this paper. Motorcycle couriers
,were chosen due to the fact that they both know streets very well and
,that they do not rely on the GPS to guide their navigation. Each trace
,"was snapped to the underlying road network, and two competing hypotheses"
,for route choice decisions were compared: (a) that riders attempt to
,minimize the Manhattan distance between locations and (b) that they
,"attempt to minimize the angular distance. In each case, the distance"
,actually traveled was compared to the minimum possible either block or
,angular distance through the road network. It is usually believed that
,drivers who know streets well will navigate trips that reduce Manhattan
,"distance; however, here it is shown that angularity appears to play ail"
,important role in route choice. 63% of trips made took the minimum
,"possible angular distance between origin and destination, while 5a.% of"
,trips followed the minimum possible block distance. This implies that
,impact of turns on cognitive distance plays an important role in
,"decision making, even when a driver has good knowledge of the spatial"
,network.

,departure from a place and buffering overlapping data for subsequent

,"coordinates, humans tend to use descriptive statements about their"
,"location; for example, ""I'm home"" or ""I'm at Starbucks."" Locations, to"
,"which a user can attach meaningful and descriptive semantics, are often"
,called places. In this paper we focus on the automatic extraction of
,places from discontinuous GPS measurements. We describe and evaluate a
,non-parametric Bayesian approach for identifying places from this kind
,of data. The main novelty of our approach is that the algorithm is fully
,automated and does not require any parameter tuning. Another novel
,aspect of our algorithm is that it can accurately identify places
,without temporal information. We evaluate our approach using data that
,has been gathered from different users and different geographic areas.
,The traces that we use exhibit different characteristics and contain
,data from daily life as well as from traveling abroad. We also compare
,our algorithm against the popular k-means algorithm. The results
,indicate that our method can accurately identify meaningful places from
,a variety of location traces and that the algorithm is robust against
,noise.

AB,"In taxicab industry, a long standing challenge is how to reduce"
,"taxicab's mileage spent without a fare, i.e., cruising mile. The current"
,solution for this challenge usually requires the participation of the
,"passengers. To solve the issue without the passengers involved, in this"
,"paper, we propose a cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to"
,maximize theirs profits by finding the optimal route to pick up a
,"passenger, thus reducing the cruising mile. In pCruise, base on"
,"collected GPS records about other near taxicabs, a taxicab characterizes"
,its cruising process with a cruising graph. When a taxicab becomes
,"vacant and tries to find a passenger, cruising graph will provide the"
,shortest cruising route with at least one expected available passengers
,"for this taxicab. With the shortest cruising routes, taxicabs will"
,significantly reduce theirs cruising miles. We evaluate pCruise based on
,"a 7 days 10 GB real world GPS dataset from a city with more than 15, 000"
,taxicabs. The evaluation results show that pCruise can assist taxicab
,drivers to reduce cruising miles by 41% on average.

AB,Determining breast density in mammograms is important both in diagnostic
,and computer-aided detection applications. Knowing the right breast
,density and having knowledge of changes in breast density could give a
,hint of a process which started to happen in a patient. Mammograms are
,projection images and suffer from problem of overlapping tissue which
,results in possibility of inaccurate detection of tissue types. The main
,problem is the fibroglandular tissue which has rather high attenuation
,of x-rays and is visible as brighter area in the resulting image. Small
,blood vessels are usually the most common interfering objects in
,mammograms. In this paper we try to suppress scattered structures which
,do not represent glandular or dense tissue in order to divide mammograms
,"more accurately in two major tissue types, fatty and dense tissue. For"
,suppressing blood vessels we have used Gabor filters of different size
,and orientation to detect edges of blood vessels and subtract them from
,the original image. Obtained results show much more homogenous areas
,which could be used for easier discrimination between tissue types.

AB,"The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS,"
,"GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with"
,"spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some"
,"extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to"
,"understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article,"
,we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and
,location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on
,"the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's"
,visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their
,"implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity"
,between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each
,"user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate"
,an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving
,his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited
,locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the
,"individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based"
,"similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each"
,"individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity"
,"among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1)"
,"the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited"
,"popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of"
,"geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into"
,"a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the"
,"user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We"
,evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75
,"subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM"
,"outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count,"
,"cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the"
,"item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides"
,users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of
,recommendation.

AB,Mobility data is becoming an important player in many application
,domains. Many techniques have been elaborated to extract statistical
,knowledge from the data sets gathering raw data tracks about the moving
,objects of interest to an application. These data tracks obey the
,physical-level specifications of the devices used for data acquisition
,"(GPS, GSM, RFID, smart phones, and other sensors). Nowadays, interest"
,has shifted from raw data tracks analysis to more application-oriented
,ways of analyzing more meaningful movement records suitable for the
,specific purposes of the application at hand. This trend has promoted
,"the concept of semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement,"
,as the core object of interest in mobility studies.
,This keynote paper intends to provide the foundations of a semantic
,approach to data about movement. It focuses on the definitions of the
,"most important concepts about mobility data, concepts that are"
,frequently used but rarely rigorously defined.

AB,The advance of GPS-enabled devices allows people to record their
,"location histories with GPS traces, which imply human behaviors and"
,"preferences related to travel. In this article, we perform two types of"
,travel recommendations by mining multiple users' GPS traces. The first
,is a generic one that recommends a user with top interesting locations
,and travel sequences in a given geospatial region. The second is a
,personalized recommendation that provides an individual with locations
,"matching her travel preferences. To achieve the first recommendation, we"
,model multiple users' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical
,"graph (TBHG). Based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced"
,Topic Search)-based model to infer the interest level of a location and
,a user's travel experience (knowledge). In the personalized
,"recommendation, we first understand the correlation between locations,"
,and then incorporate this correlation into a collaborative filtering
,"(CF)-based model, which predicts a user's interests in an unvisited"
,location based on her locations histories and that of others. We
,evaluated our system based on a real-world GPS trace dataset collected
,"by 107 users over a period of one year. As a result, our HITS-based"
,inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and
,"rank-by-frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved a better performance in"
,recommending travel sequences beyond baselines like rank-by-count.
,"Regarding the personalized recommendation, our approach is more"
,effective than the weighted Slope One algorithm with a slightly
,"additional computation, and is more efficient than the Pearson"
,correlation-based CF model with the similar effectiveness.

AB,The discovery of a person's meaningful places involves obtaining the
,physical locations and their labels for a person's places that matter to
,his daily life and routines. This problem is driven by the requirements
,"from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose"
,"queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example,"
,"""home"", ""work"" or ""Northwest Health Club"". It is a challenge to map from"
,physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of
,understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful
,places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal
,"places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical"
,"evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware"
,applications in the dark about their choices.
,Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to
,discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics
,and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale
,experiment that collected real users' location data and personally
,"meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation"
,framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure
,itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers
,places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means
,"clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence"
,"that shapes more complex than ""points"" are required to represent the"
,full range of people's everyday places.

AB,"With the continuing advances in wireless communications,"
,"geo-positioning, and portable electronics, an infrastructure is emerging"
,"that enables the delivery of on-line, location-enabled services to very"
,large numbers of mobile users. A typical usage situation for mobile
,"services is one characterized by a small screen and no keyboard, and by"
,the service being only a secondary focus of the user. Under such
,"circumstances, it is particularly important to deliver the ""right"""
,"information and service at the right time, with as little user"
,interaction as possible. This may be achieved by making services context
,aware. Mobile users frequently follow the same route to a destination as
,"they did during previous trips to the destination, and the route and"
,destination constitute important aspects of the context for a range of
,services. This paper presents key concepts underlying a software
,component that identifies and accumulates the routes of a user along
,with their usage patterns and that makes the routes available to
,"services. The problems associated with of route recording are analyzed,"
,and algorithms that solve the problems are presented. Experiences from
,using the component on logs of GPS positions acquired from vehicles
,traveling within a real road network are reported.

AB,Location is the most essential presence information for mobile users. In
,"this paper, we present an improved time-based clustering technique for"
,extracting significant locations from CPS data stream. This new location
,extraction mechanism is incorporated with Google Maps for realizing
,cooperative place annotation on mobile instant messengers (MIM). To
,"enhance the context-awareness of the MIM system, we further develop an"
,ontology-based presence model for inferring the location clues of IM
,buddies. The GPS-based location extraction algorithm has been
,implemented on a Smartphone and evaluated using a real-life GPS trace.
,We show that the proposed clustering algorithm can achieve more accurate
,results as it considers the time interval of intermittent location
,revisits. The incorporation of location information with the high-level
,"contexts, such as mobile user's current activity and their social"
,"relationship, can achieve more responsive and accurate presence update."

AB,The user profile is one of the main context-information in a wide range
,of pervasive computing applications. Modem handheld devices provided
,with localization capabilities could automatically create a diary of
,user's whereabouts and use that information as a surrogate (or a
,"complement) of the user profile. The places we go, in fact, reveal also"
,"something about us, for example, two persons can be matched as"
,compatible given the fact they visit the same places. Web-retrieved
,"information, and the temporal patterns with which different places are"
,"visited, can be used to automatically define meaningful semantic labels"
,to the visited places. In our work we used geocoding and white-pages
,"Web-services to extract information about a place, and Bayesian networks"
,to classify places on the basis of the time in which they have been
,visited. In this paper we describe the general idea at the basis of the
,"whereabouts diary, discuss our implementation, and present experimental"
,"results. Finally, several applications that can exploit the diary are"
,illustrated.

,nodes (anchors) and mobile nodes (people). From a set of sparse
,connectivity matrices (people vs. people and people vs. anchors) at each

,"combine connectivity and dynamic information, we propose an extension of"
,"Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Dynamic Weighted MDS (DWMDS), that finds"
,an embedding of people's trajectories (x and y coordinates of people

,"especially for low connectivity degree networks (i.e. sparse networks),"
,compared to existing location algorithms. Extensive simulations show the
,effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

AB,Personal experience computing is an emerging research area in computing
,"support for capturing, archiving, and editing. This paper presents our"
,"design, implementation, and evaluation of a mobile authoring tool called"
,mProducer that enables everyday users to effectively and efficiently
,perform archiving and editing at or immediately after the
,point-of-capture of digital personal experiences from their
,camera-equipped mobile devices. This point-of-capture capability is
,crucial to enable immediate sharing of digital personal experiences
,"anytime, anywhere. For example, we have seen everyday people who used"
,"handheld camcorders to capture and report their personal, eye-witnessed"
,"experiences during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York"
,(The September I I Digital Archive. http://www.911digitalarchive.org/).
,"With mProducer, they would be able to perform editing immediately after"
,"the point of capture, and then share these newsworthy, time-sensitive"
,digital experiences on the Internet. To address the challenges in both
,user interface constraints and limited system resources on a mobile
,"device, mProducer provides the following innovative system techniques"
,and UI designs. (1) Keyframe-based editing UI enables everyday users to
,easily and efficiently edit recorded digital experiences from a mobile
,device using only key frames with the storyboard metaphor. (2) Storage
,constrained uploading (SCU) algorithm archives continuous multimedia
,data by uploading them to remote storage servers at the point of
,"capture, so that it alleviates the problem of limited storage on a"
,mobile device. (3) Sensor-assisted automated editing uses data from a
,GPS receiver and a tilt sensor attached to a mobile device to facilitate
,two manual editing steps at the point of capture: removal of blurry
,"frames from hand-induced camera shaking, and content search via"
,location-based content management. We have conducted user studies to
,evaluate mProducer. Results from the user studies have shown that
,"mProducer scores high in user satisfaction in editing experience,"
,"editing quality, task performance time, ease of use, and ease of"

,"driver's destinations, along with data about driving behaviors, to"
,predict where a driver is going as a trip progresses. Driving behaviors
,"include types of destinations, driving efficiency, and trip times."
,"Beyond considering previously visited destinations, Predestination"
,leverages an open-world modeling methodology that considers the
,likelihood of users visiting previously unobserved locations based on
,trends in the data and on the background properties of locations. This
,"allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between ""out of the box"""
,with no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of
,observations. Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian
,inference to produce a probabilistic map of destinations. Our algorithm
,was trained and tested on hold-out data drawn from a database of GPS
,"driving data gathered from 169 different subjects who drove 7,335"

AB,Unmanned vehicle driving systems are getting interesting for the auto
,mobile industry. One of the key issues in the unmanned vehicle driving
,system is how to acquire the current position of the vehicle. In
,"general, it can be achieved by Global Positioning System (GPS). However"
,if the unmanned vehicle will be parked in the parking garage by itself
,GPS can not provide sufficient information to avoid collisions and the
,accuracy of GPS is not enough for the narrow parking space. An automatic
,vehicle parking system is proposed in the paper where wireless sensor
,networks and infrared technologies are adopted simultaneously to enhance
,the accuracy of positioning. The prototype of the proposed automatic
,vehicle parking system is also implemented.

,"testing on different devices, and calibration data density. We collected"
,"a 208-hour, 4350 Km driving trace of three different GSM networks"
,covering the Seattle metropolitan area. We show a median error of 94m in
,downtown and 196m in residential areas using a single GSM network and
,the best algorithm for each area. Estimating location using multiple
,providers' cells reduces median error to 65-134 meters and 95% error to
,"163m in the downtown area, which meets the accuracy requirements for"
,E911. We also show that a small 60-hour calibration drive is sufficient
,for enabling a metropolitan area similar to Seattle.

,"implementation, outdoor locations can be detected as well indoor"
,locations visited by the users. Once the list of locations is

,scanned for transitions between location groups to find the routes. If
,there are similar routes between origin and destination then these will
,"be merged, and finally a list of different routes between two locations"
,will be obtained. This; technique could be used as part of a monitoring
,system for vehicles that are aware of their location and security as
,well as using logs from different users to create a dynamic map of the
,regions where digital maps are not available or not feasible.

AB,Location contexts are important for many context-aware applications. A
,significant location is a specialized form of location context for
,expressing a user's daily activity. We propose a method to cluster
,positions measured by cellular phones into significant locations with
,multiple radii. Cellular phones we used are equipped with a positioning
,"system, where data can be taken in low frequency with wide-varying"
,"estimated errors. In order to learn significant locations, our system"
,exploits multiple radii for coping with these characteristics and for
,adapting to a variety of users' spatial behavioral patterns. We also
,discuss appropriate parameters for our clustering method.

,prediction by comparing several prediction methods. The scenario
,concerns people in an office building visiting offices in a regular

,Bayesian network and evaluate accuracy of next room prediction and of
,"duration of stay, training and retraining performance, as well as memory"
,and performance requirements of a Bayesian network predictor. The
,results are compared with further context predictor approaches - a state
,predictor and a multi-layer perceptron predictor using exactly the same
,evaluation set-up and benchmarks. The publicly available Augsburg Indoor
,Location Tracking Benchmarks are applied as predictor loads. Our results
,show that the Bayesian network predictor reaches a next location
,prediction accuracy of up to 90% and a duration prediction accuracy of
,up to 87% with variations depending on the person and specific predictor
,set-up. The Bayesian network predictor performs in the same accuracy
,range as the neural network and the state predictor.

AB,People often misplace objects they care about. We present a system that
,generates reminders about objects left behind by tagging those objects
,with passive RFID tags. Readers positioned in the environment frequented
,by users read tags and broadcast the tags' IDs over a short-range
,wireless medium. A user's personal server collects the read events in
,real-time and processes them to determine if a reminder is warranted or
,not. The reminders are delivered to a wristwatch-sized device through a
,combination of text messages and audible beeps. We believe this leads to
,a practical and scalable approach in terms of system architecture and
,user experience as well as being more amenable to maintaining user
,privacy than previous approaches. We present results that demonstrate
,that current RFID tag technology is appropriate for this application
,when integrated with calendar information.

AB,"An ad-hoc network of wireless static nodes is considered as it arises in a rapidly deployed, sensor based, monitoring system."
,Information is generated in certain nodes and needs to reach a set of designated gateway nodes.
,Each node may adjust its power within a certain range that determines the set of possible one hop away neighbors.
,Traffic forwarding through multiple hops is employed when the intended destination is not within immediate reach.
,The nodes have limited initial amounts of energy that is consumed in different rates depending on the power level and the intended receiver.
,We propose algorithms to select the routes and the corresponding power levels such that the time until the batteries of the nodes drain-out is maximized.
,"The algorithms are local and amenable to distributed implementation. When there is a single power level, the problem is reduced to a maximum flow problem with node capacities and the algorithms converge to the optimal solution."
,When there are multiple power levels then the achievable lifetime is close to the optimal (that is computed by linear programming) most of the time.
,"It turns out that in order to maximize the lifetime, the traffic should be routed such that the energy consumption is balanced among the nodes in proportion to their energy reserves, instead of routing to minimize the absolute consumed power."
